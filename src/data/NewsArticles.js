      "Welcome back to Ask The Argus, our semi-regular advice column brought to you by the magnificent Features section! ",
      "Every once in a while we bring you the hottest advice from our fabulous, trusty, seasoned editors. Scrambling to finish all of your work before you leave? Wishing that it wasn’t so cold outside? Struggling to pack for that awkward in-between period that’s not quite fall break and not quite winter break? We’ve got you covered. ",
      "Read ahead for answers to your most buzzing questions about this coming spring from the most esteemed section of The Argus.",
      "I have an exam, two papers, and a presentation all before I leave next week. Any suggestions for this dire quagmire? ",
      "Breathe. We know how overwhelming the last few weeks before spring break can feel, but you’ve got this! Stay organized, tackle tasks one at a time, and don’t forget to take breaks when needed. Prioritize what is most urgent, lean on your support system, and keep pushing forward—spring break is just around the corner. Also remember that the first week or two after spring break is usually pretty mellow. ",
      "What should I pack for spring break?",
      "If you have warm, glamorous plans: sunscreen. And if you’re staying somewhere cooler, pack layers to handle the unpredictable spring weather. Either way, don’t forget your travel essentials: chargers, travel-sized toiletries, passport, phone, wallet, and your WesID for when you get back. ",
      "Spring break is also a great time to start bringing your heavy winter jackets, gloves, and scarves home, making room for lighter layers and spring clothes. Pro tip: Spruce up your wardrobe with floral skirts, light cardigans, flowy midi dresses, and everything denim from WesThrift. ",
      "Snow. Snow. Snow. Unending snow. When will it end? ",
      "Although the first week of March does not bring the sun, it does bring a respectably-raised barometer. Temperatures are finally looking up. We’re hitting 50 degrees! Fahrenheit, not Celsius, but c’est la vie. The Beatles had it right. Little darlings, it has been a long, cold, lonely winter, but sunshine is not far away.",
      "Spring is creeping in with its quiet persistence. You’ll notice it in the way the days stretch just a little longer, the way the air smells a bit fresher, and the way jackets start to feel like overkill by midday. And before you know it, the snow will be a distant memory replaced by chirping birds, Pi Café iced coffees, and Foss Hill picnics.",
      "I’ve burned through all my points for the semester already. What do I do? ",
      "If you’re an upperclassman, cooking can be a great fix for your lack of points and counts as self-care! Cooking is also a great way to hang out with your roommates or housemates, especially if the frenzy of midterms is making your schedules irreconcilable. And seriously, don’t be conned by underclassmen for points. Leeches, am I right? ",
      "If you’re an underclassman, at this point in the semester, you should have at least 2-3 upperclassmen friends that can sponsor your pricey Swings and Red and Black meals—that’s just financial literacy 101. Alas, if not, there are still ways to get around it. For example, if you spend countless points on sweet treats at Pi Café like we do, scout areas that have stashes of free food—pastries that your professor brings to Office Hours, for instance. As a last resort, you can always refill your points in WesPortal, under the Offices and Services section, through WesCard. ",
      "What are some things I can do to still be somewhat productive over break? ",
      "Apply to the following: Internships! Summer jobs! Summer research! A summer session class! (P.S. The summer session aid application opens this Monday, March 3.) Think more about your housing plans for next semester. Journal, do your readings ahead of time, pick up a new hobby, or write critiques of student publications that advise you to be productive over break. ",

      "Campus Hosts Vigil for Ukraine on Third Anniversary of Russia’s Full-Scale Invasion",
    date: "February 25, 2025",
    authors: "Janhavi Munde",

      "On Monday, Feb. 24 at 12:15 p.m., student organizers and faculty held a vigil at the Zelnick Pavilion to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion and occupation of Ukraine. Organized by Oleksandra Volakova ’27 and Kseniia Guliaeva ’25 and co-sponsored by the Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies Department (REES), the Dance Department, and the Fries Center for Global Studies, the event drew a crowd of attendees, including faculty and staff members, international students from Russia, Ukraine, and other Eastern European countries, and other students wh0 joined in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.",
      "Lasting for an hour, the vigil began with a series of remarks from faculty speakers and event organizers. After a break for discussion, several students and faculty came up to share personal anecdotes and experiences with the war. The vigil concluded with a minute of silence in mourning for the lives lost in the war, followed by a collective singing of the Ukrainian national anthem.",
      "Around the venue, student organizers hung up posters with information about the war and displayed postcards showing the atrocities of Russia’s invasion. Attendees were encouraged to donate money to Ukrainian communities in need via cash or a printed QR code. Traditional Ukrainian snacks and refreshments were provided, along with badges, temporary tattoos, and stickers that expressed support for Ukraine.",
      "Associate Professor of Dance Katja Kolcio, who was the primary faculty organizer of the vigil, shared her thoughts on the student initiative and the significance of the day.",
      "“This day is a deeply meaningful and emotional day, as it marks the third year of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Kolcio wrote in an email to The Argus. “We are all grateful to everyone who dedicated time, care, and devoted attention to honoring the Ukrainians who are indeed defending principles of freedom, social justice, and democracy for all of us.”",
      "The vigil had a high turnout, with over 30 attendants, although organizers reported having difficulties scheduling the event. ",
      "“There was a challenge associated with the fact that a pro-Palestinian rally had been scheduled for the same day,” Assistant Professor of the Practice in REES Natasha Karageorgos wrote in an email to The Argus. “February 24 is a tragic day for Ukraine and all of us who support it, so we asked to reschedule the other rally because they could do it anytime. This request was not satisfied…. But we are grateful that so many people came, even though they had to miss lunch and run from or to a class. We have outstanding students from Ukraine who organized this event.”",
      "For the past two years, Volakova, an international student from Ukraine, has been actively raising awareness about the war in Ukraine at the University. She has organized film screenings, conducted interviews with Ukrainians on the ground this past summer, and hosted on-campus events, including a talk at the Wasch Center for Retired Faculty earlier this month.",
      "Despite stating that she has never met a person who has not been in support of Ukraine at the University, Volakova noted that the momentum for social organization has generally dwindled.",
      "“It was a surprise for everyone in 2022, but now people are not as interested anymore,” Volakova said. “You can see that there [are] more…older people, like more professors who have come, […] instead of students, [for whom] it’s not as interesting anymore.” ",
      "Volakova also spoke about some ways that the student body can get involved in aiding Ukraine.",
      "“Please do not forget,” Volakova said. “That’s the most important [thing]. If you cannot make any donations, just read the news. Remember that there are still people who are dying in Ukraine. There are still people who are getting killed, who are being bombed, children who are dying, elderly who cannot leave their villages that are occupied….”",
      "Karageorgos shared ways in which students can academically involve themselves with Ukraine’s cause. She added that she coordinates a project dedicated to the preservation of the legacy of the Mariupol Greeks and that even if students cannot read or write Ukrainian or Russian, they can still assist in editing and proofreading.",
      "Associate Professor of the Practice in French Liana Pshevorska, who is from Ukraine, has set up a GoFundMe for delivering medical aid to Ukrainians. She noted that the faculty will support students with similar initiatives to help Ukraine. ",
      "“We as faculty are always happy to support them in any way we can,” Pshevorska wrote in an email to The Argus. “I am confident that this will not be the only event dedicated to Ukraine this year…. There are so many things outside our control, so it’s important to focus on our own actions—donating, contacting representatives, holding public events.”",
      "Faculty members at the vigil emphasized the need for such events, given the changing dynamics of U.S. involvement with Russia. On Monday, Feb. 24, in a resounding break in its foreign policy—which has sent significant military and financial aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in 2022—the United States voted against a U.N. resolution that condemns Russian aggression in Ukraine and calls for the occupied Ukrainian territories to be returned. Alongside U.S. stances on U.N. resolutions that indicated more affinity towards Russia, President Trump has recently called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator and accused Ukraine of starting the war.",
      "“Things are not looking good for Ukraine right now, with President Trump apparently willing to help Putin achieve his goal of establishing Russian control over Ukraine,” Professor of Government Peter Rutland wrote in an email to The Argus.",
      "Kolcio echoed this sentiment, adding that the implications of changing U.S. foreign policy impact American citizens as well.",
      "“I wish more people (and our government in particular) would understand the implications and risks of Putin’s aggression for global peace, democracy, and freedom in general in the world,” Kolcio wrote. “The current gestures being made by our government of appeasing Putin endanger not only Ukraine but the U.S. as well.” ",
      "At the vigil, Associate Professor of Russian Language and Literature Emeritus Duffield White recounted his experience witnessing Ukraine’s history unfold from the time he began teaching at the University in the 1970s.",
      "“[In 1991, Ukrainians overwhelmingly] voted to become an independent country,” White said at the vigil. “When Putin started this war three years ago, he intended to take Kyiv within five days, and most people expected that would happen. And it hasn’t. And it has been the biggest miracle that I’ve lived through: these last three years, Ukraine fighting to maintain its independence.”",
      "Faculty also noted the role of the REES department in the ongoing political developments.",
      "“REES has increased its offering of courses on Ukraine in history, government, and arts as the current events unfold,” Kolcio wrote.",
      "According to Yehor Mishchyriak ’26, another international student from Ukraine, although the full-scale war on Ukraine began three years ago, Ukrainians have been facing Russian aggression for much longer.",
      "“This is a horrible event, and it’s been going on for 11 years now,” Mishchyriak said. “Not three years. People often recall three years, [but this] has been only the full-scale war. But the first aggression against the independent Ukraine happened in 2014—this is when my family and I were displaced for the first time.”",
      "Some Ukrainian faculty members remembered even further back.",
      "“A ‘peace’ imposed without Ukrainian participation will not end the genocide,” Kolcio wrote. “History has demonstrated that this would be the case: My uncle died in a Siberian labor camp in the 1970s and my aunt was imprisoned for holding Ukrainian language readings. This was during ‘peace’.”",
      "Nonetheless, faculty and students all emphasized the hope and resilience they carry while organizing and spreading awareness.",
      "“But Ukraine has experienced even more devastating challenges in its past—the famine of the 1930s, the Stalinist purges, the Nazi occupation,” Rutland wrote. “And it bounced back.”",
      "White expressed a similar sentiment at the vigil.",
      "“They’ve been miraculous for 3 years,” White said. “They will prevail.”",

      "If you’re an international student at an American college or university who plans to participate in a political protest this year, reconsider. This precaution is not to monger fear, or to promote silence, or even to reinforce bystanderism. As a fellow international studying at an American university with a politically active student body, I believe we must review our standing, resources, and precarious status. More specifically, if one studies at a liberal arts university where political protests such as the pro-Palestine encampments have occurred and been met with\u00a0repressive police presence, one must consider what the past year’s election results bring with them for international students.",
      "The extreme right-wing policies that will\u00a0loom over the country for many of our college careers are a larger threat to international students of color than they are\u00a0to students with citizenship. Most international students study at American universities on\u00a0F-1 or J-1 student visas, which are subject to review and can be canceled if the student has questionable\u00a0academic or legal standing. In January, President Trump signed Executive Order 14188 titled “Additional Measures to Combat Antisemitism,” which urges universities to “monitor” international students for criminal activity, relating specifically to pro-Palestine protests.\u00a0",
      "“Come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,”\u00a0read\u00a0a White House fact sheet about\u00a0Trump’s executive\u00a0order.\u00a0",
      "Beyond protests for the liberation of Palestine or university divestment, international students have cultural and national reasons for demonstrating. For example,\u00a0Wesleyan’s Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies Department is facilitating student-organized events for the three-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which will be attended by many international students. Even in private institutions such as Wesleyan, federal policies impact international students’ activist discourse, largely because of potential legal consequences for engaging in activism on campus.\u00a0",
      "An international student’s violation of the academic code of conduct may precipitate suspension, which would then constitute a violation\u00a0of visa status. A\u00a0recent example\u00a0of this issue\u00a0during former President Biden’s administration was the suspension and threatened\u00a0deportation of international graduate student Momodou Taal (originally from the United Kingdom) from Cornell University in 2024. After his participation in a pro-Palestinian protest during a career fair, Taal was suspended and unenrolled from\u00a0Cornell, and subsequently faced deportation charges on basis of the violation of his visa status. Although Taal is\u00a0not facing deportation\u00a0anymore, and is now only banned from campus, the new administration may not be as forgiving. Trump is vowing to deport international\u00a0students for simply protesting.",
      "This comes despite Trump’s statement\u00a0on a podcast\u00a0in June 2024 that foreign students studying in America should receive green cards upon graduation. Despite this, there is much precedent for our persecution (as seen in Taal’s case), and no policy framework for our protection (Trump’s promise was soon\u00a0rolled back\u00a0by his spokesperson).\u00a0",
      "Immigration experts aren’t persuaded either.\u00a0",
      "“I almost have to laugh because [Trump’s first-term] administration adopted multiple policies aiming to restrict student visas and make it harder for people to stay in the country after graduating,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council,\u00a0in a Reuters article.",
      "Admittedly, there are two valuable counterarguments. First\u00a0is that cases like Taal’s may be unique and don’t represent a national pattern. Second\u00a0is that international students are aware of America’s political climate and their universities’ policies, and study here willingly. Consequences of breaching said policies should not come as a surprise, nor should they be labeled discriminatory or persecutory.",
      "While I concede that cases like Taal’s are unique, the restrictions faced by internationals under Trump’s first presidential term weren’t. The Trump administration\u00a0initiated a 90-day travel\u00a0ban in 2017 for foreigners from Muslim countries and introduced a plethora of policy reviews for their stay duration, while attempting to eliminate\u00a0Optional Practical Training, a program that\u00a0allows international students to work in the U.S. post-graduation. Moreover, while international students enjoy protection under American law in return for acknowledging their university’s policies, they also enjoy student culture and student rights—one such right has historically been the freedom to peacefully protest. Accepting national and educational sovereignty does not exclude an international from the universal right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.",
      "Students must, in this context, rethink what activism means for them. At this point, it might be smarter and safer to create change in the background, while reducing physical protest\u00a0in the foreground. Risking one’s educational status for ideals is an admirable showcase\u00a0of conviction, but comes with danger. Finishing one’s education, accessing resources in the longer term, advocating strategically, and protecting our stay here is the path that now may provide more scope for impactful activism—as opposed to getting arrested the day of your first on-campus protest.",
      "We should stay here long enough to invoke meaningful change. Our officials, our political landscape, and our legal realities are changing. Our activism shouldn’t\u00a0shirk, but rather transform to meet this.",
      "Voicing dissent and impressing change is still possible, as it must be. Writing for on-campus publications, engaging with international student forums and bodies like Wesleyan International Speakers Program and the International Student Advisory Board, continuing conversations with family back home and diaspora in America, forming connections with faculty, organizing civic engagement workshops, and building relationships with community organizations are only some of\u00a0the ways to ensure one’s activism reaches beyond the ivory tower while sustaining one’s ability to act over time. Keeping in touch with educational immigration officials and the University’s\u00a0Office of International Student Affairs\u00a0is also key for being updated about new policies and regulations.\u00a0",
      "It may be tempting to throw in the towel, and the books, and your Wes merch-turned-souvenir, and then book a one-way flight home. The international student presence on campus brings great assets to the political culture of any institution that welcomes it, and we must remember that. There are still ways to spur change in America safely under the new administration’s dangerous policies, and it is important that we seek out these methods to ensure our voices can remain heard.",
