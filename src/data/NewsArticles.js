      "Welcome back to Ask The Argus, our semi-regular advice column brought to you by the magnificent Features section! ",
      "Every once in a while we bring you the hottest advice from our fabulous, trusty, seasoned editors. Scrambling to finish all of your work before you leave? Wishing that it wasn’t so cold outside? Struggling to pack for that awkward in-between period that’s not quite fall break and not quite winter break? We’ve got you covered. ",
      "Read ahead for answers to your most buzzing questions about this coming spring from the most esteemed section of The Argus.",
      "I have an exam, two papers, and a presentation all before I leave next week. Any suggestions for this dire quagmire? ",
      "Breathe. We know how overwhelming the last few weeks before spring break can feel, but you’ve got this! Stay organized, tackle tasks one at a time, and don’t forget to take breaks when needed. Prioritize what is most urgent, lean on your support system, and keep pushing forward—spring break is just around the corner. Also remember that the first week or two after spring break is usually pretty mellow. ",
      "What should I pack for spring break?",
      "If you have warm, glamorous plans: sunscreen. And if you’re staying somewhere cooler, pack layers to handle the unpredictable spring weather. Either way, don’t forget your travel essentials: chargers, travel-sized toiletries, passport, phone, wallet, and your WesID for when you get back. ",
      "Spring break is also a great time to start bringing your heavy winter jackets, gloves, and scarves home, making room for lighter layers and spring clothes. Pro tip: Spruce up your wardrobe with floral skirts, light cardigans, flowy midi dresses, and everything denim from WesThrift. ",
      "Snow. Snow. Snow. Unending snow. When will it end? ",
      "Although the first week of March does not bring the sun, it does bring a respectably-raised barometer. Temperatures are finally looking up. We’re hitting 50 degrees! Fahrenheit, not Celsius, but c’est la vie. The Beatles had it right. Little darlings, it has been a long, cold, lonely winter, but sunshine is not far away.",
      "Spring is creeping in with its quiet persistence. You’ll notice it in the way the days stretch just a little longer, the way the air smells a bit fresher, and the way jackets start to feel like overkill by midday. And before you know it, the snow will be a distant memory replaced by chirping birds, Pi Café iced coffees, and Foss Hill picnics.",
      "I’ve burned through all my points for the semester already. What do I do? ",
      "If you’re an upperclassman, cooking can be a great fix for your lack of points and counts as self-care! Cooking is also a great way to hang out with your roommates or housemates, especially if the frenzy of midterms is making your schedules irreconcilable. And seriously, don’t be conned by underclassmen for points. Leeches, am I right? ",
      "If you’re an underclassman, at this point in the semester, you should have at least 2-3 upperclassmen friends that can sponsor your pricey Swings and Red and Black meals—that’s just financial literacy 101. Alas, if not, there are still ways to get around it. For example, if you spend countless points on sweet treats at Pi Café like we do, scout areas that have stashes of free food—pastries that your professor brings to Office Hours, for instance. As a last resort, you can always refill your points in WesPortal, under the Offices and Services section, through WesCard. ",
      "What are some things I can do to still be somewhat productive over break? ",
      "Apply to the following: Internships! Summer jobs! Summer research! A summer session class! (P.S. The summer session aid application opens this Monday, March 3.) Think more about your housing plans for next semester. Journal, do your readings ahead of time, pick up a new hobby, or write critiques of student publications that advise you to be productive over break. ",

      "Campus Hosts Vigil for Ukraine on Third Anniversary of Russia’s Full-Scale Invasion",
    date: "February 25, 2025",
    authors: "Janhavi Munde",

      "On Monday, Feb. 24 at 12:15 p.m., student organizers and faculty held a vigil at the Zelnick Pavilion to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion and occupation of Ukraine. Organized by Oleksandra Volakova ’27 and Kseniia Guliaeva ’25 and co-sponsored by the Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies Department (REES), the Dance Department, and the Fries Center for Global Studies, the event drew a crowd of attendees, including faculty and staff members, international students from Russia, Ukraine, and other Eastern European countries, and other students wh0 joined in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.",
      "Lasting for an hour, the vigil began with a series of remarks from faculty speakers and event organizers. After a break for discussion, several students and faculty came up to share personal anecdotes and experiences with the war. The vigil concluded with a minute of silence in mourning for the lives lost in the war, followed by a collective singing of the Ukrainian national anthem.",
      "Around the venue, student organizers hung up posters with information about the war and displayed postcards showing the atrocities of Russia’s invasion. Attendees were encouraged to donate money to Ukrainian communities in need via cash or a printed QR code. Traditional Ukrainian snacks and refreshments were provided, along with badges, temporary tattoos, and stickers that expressed support for Ukraine.",
      "Associate Professor of Dance Katja Kolcio, who was the primary faculty organizer of the vigil, shared her thoughts on the student initiative and the significance of the day.",
      "“This day is a deeply meaningful and emotional day, as it marks the third year of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Kolcio wrote in an email to The Argus. “We are all grateful to everyone who dedicated time, care, and devoted attention to honoring the Ukrainians who are indeed defending principles of freedom, social justice, and democracy for all of us.”",
      "The vigil had a high turnout, with over 30 attendants, although organizers reported having difficulties scheduling the event. ",
      "“There was a challenge associated with the fact that a pro-Palestinian rally had been scheduled for the same day,” Assistant Professor of the Practice in REES Natasha Karageorgos wrote in an email to The Argus. “February 24 is a tragic day for Ukraine and all of us who support it, so we asked to reschedule the other rally because they could do it anytime. This request was not satisfied…. But we are grateful that so many people came, even though they had to miss lunch and run from or to a class. We have outstanding students from Ukraine who organized this event.”",
      "For the past two years, Volakova, an international student from Ukraine, has been actively raising awareness about the war in Ukraine at the University. She has organized film screenings, conducted interviews with Ukrainians on the ground this past summer, and hosted on-campus events, including a talk at the Wasch Center for Retired Faculty earlier this month.",
      "Despite stating that she has never met a person who has not been in support of Ukraine at the University, Volakova noted that the momentum for social organization has generally dwindled.",
      "“It was a surprise for everyone in 2022, but now people are not as interested anymore,” Volakova said. “You can see that there [are] more…older people, like more professors who have come, […] instead of students, [for whom] it’s not as interesting anymore.” ",
      "Volakova also spoke about some ways that the student body can get involved in aiding Ukraine.",
      "“Please do not forget,” Volakova said. “That’s the most important [thing]. If you cannot make any donations, just read the news. Remember that there are still people who are dying in Ukraine. There are still people who are getting killed, who are being bombed, children who are dying, elderly who cannot leave their villages that are occupied….”",
      "Karageorgos shared ways in which students can academically involve themselves with Ukraine’s cause. She added that she coordinates a project dedicated to the preservation of the legacy of the Mariupol Greeks and that even if students cannot read or write Ukrainian or Russian, they can still assist in editing and proofreading.",
      "Associate Professor of the Practice in French Liana Pshevorska, who is from Ukraine, has set up a GoFundMe for delivering medical aid to Ukrainians. She noted that the faculty will support students with similar initiatives to help Ukraine. ",
      "“We as faculty are always happy to support them in any way we can,” Pshevorska wrote in an email to The Argus. “I am confident that this will not be the only event dedicated to Ukraine this year…. There are so many things outside our control, so it’s important to focus on our own actions—donating, contacting representatives, holding public events.”",
      "Faculty members at the vigil emphasized the need for such events, given the changing dynamics of U.S. involvement with Russia. On Monday, Feb. 24, in a resounding break in its foreign policy—which has sent significant military and financial aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in 2022—the United States voted against a U.N. resolution that condemns Russian aggression in Ukraine and calls for the occupied Ukrainian territories to be returned. Alongside U.S. stances on U.N. resolutions that indicated more affinity towards Russia, President Trump has recently called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator and accused Ukraine of starting the war.",
      "“Things are not looking good for Ukraine right now, with President Trump apparently willing to help Putin achieve his goal of establishing Russian control over Ukraine,” Professor of Government Peter Rutland wrote in an email to The Argus.",
      "Kolcio echoed this sentiment, adding that the implications of changing U.S. foreign policy impact American citizens as well.",
      "“I wish more people (and our government in particular) would understand the implications and risks of Putin’s aggression for global peace, democracy, and freedom in general in the world,” Kolcio wrote. “The current gestures being made by our government of appeasing Putin endanger not only Ukraine but the U.S. as well.” ",
      "At the vigil, Associate Professor of Russian Language and Literature Emeritus Duffield White recounted his experience witnessing Ukraine’s history unfold from the time he began teaching at the University in the 1970s.",
      "“[In 1991, Ukrainians overwhelmingly] voted to become an independent country,” White said at the vigil. “When Putin started this war three years ago, he intended to take Kyiv within five days, and most people expected that would happen. And it hasn’t. And it has been the biggest miracle that I’ve lived through: these last three years, Ukraine fighting to maintain its independence.”",
      "Faculty also noted the role of the REES department in the ongoing political developments.",
      "“REES has increased its offering of courses on Ukraine in history, government, and arts as the current events unfold,” Kolcio wrote.",
      "According to Yehor Mishchyriak ’26, another international student from Ukraine, although the full-scale war on Ukraine began three years ago, Ukrainians have been facing Russian aggression for much longer.",
      "“This is a horrible event, and it’s been going on for 11 years now,” Mishchyriak said. “Not three years. People often recall three years, [but this] has been only the full-scale war. But the first aggression against the independent Ukraine happened in 2014—this is when my family and I were displaced for the first time.”",
      "Some Ukrainian faculty members remembered even further back.",
      "“A ‘peace’ imposed without Ukrainian participation will not end the genocide,” Kolcio wrote. “History has demonstrated that this would be the case: My uncle died in a Siberian labor camp in the 1970s and my aunt was imprisoned for holding Ukrainian language readings. This was during ‘peace’.”",
      "Nonetheless, faculty and students all emphasized the hope and resilience they carry while organizing and spreading awareness.",
      "“But Ukraine has experienced even more devastating challenges in its past—the famine of the 1930s, the Stalinist purges, the Nazi occupation,” Rutland wrote. “And it bounced back.”",
      "White expressed a similar sentiment at the vigil.",
      "“They’ve been miraculous for 3 years,” White said. “They will prevail.”",

      "If you’re an international student at an American college or university who plans to participate in a political protest this year, reconsider. This precaution is not to monger fear, or to promote silence, or even to reinforce bystanderism. As a fellow international studying at an American university with a politically active student body, I believe we must review our standing, resources, and precarious status. More specifically, if one studies at a liberal arts university where political protests such as the pro-Palestine encampments have occurred and been met with\u00a0repressive police presence, one must consider what the past year’s election results bring with them for international students.",
      "The extreme right-wing policies that will\u00a0loom over the country for many of our college careers are a larger threat to international students of color than they are\u00a0to students with citizenship. Most international students study at American universities on\u00a0F-1 or J-1 student visas, which are subject to review and can be canceled if the student has questionable\u00a0academic or legal standing. In January, President Trump signed Executive Order 14188 titled “Additional Measures to Combat Antisemitism,” which urges universities to “monitor” international students for criminal activity, relating specifically to pro-Palestine protests.\u00a0",
      "“Come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,”\u00a0read\u00a0a White House fact sheet about\u00a0Trump’s executive\u00a0order.\u00a0",
      "Beyond protests for the liberation of Palestine or university divestment, international students have cultural and national reasons for demonstrating. For example,\u00a0Wesleyan’s Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies Department is facilitating student-organized events for the three-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which will be attended by many international students. Even in private institutions such as Wesleyan, federal policies impact international students’ activist discourse, largely because of potential legal consequences for engaging in activism on campus.\u00a0",
      "An international student’s violation of the academic code of conduct may precipitate suspension, which would then constitute a violation\u00a0of visa status. A\u00a0recent example\u00a0of this issue\u00a0during former President Biden’s administration was the suspension and threatened\u00a0deportation of international graduate student Momodou Taal (originally from the United Kingdom) from Cornell University in 2024. After his participation in a pro-Palestinian protest during a career fair, Taal was suspended and unenrolled from\u00a0Cornell, and subsequently faced deportation charges on basis of the violation of his visa status. Although Taal is\u00a0not facing deportation\u00a0anymore, and is now only banned from campus, the new administration may not be as forgiving. Trump is vowing to deport international\u00a0students for simply protesting.",
      "This comes despite Trump’s statement\u00a0on a podcast\u00a0in June 2024 that foreign students studying in America should receive green cards upon graduation. Despite this, there is much precedent for our persecution (as seen in Taal’s case), and no policy framework for our protection (Trump’s promise was soon\u00a0rolled back\u00a0by his spokesperson).\u00a0",
      "Immigration experts aren’t persuaded either.\u00a0",
      "“I almost have to laugh because [Trump’s first-term] administration adopted multiple policies aiming to restrict student visas and make it harder for people to stay in the country after graduating,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council,\u00a0in a Reuters article.",
      "Admittedly, there are two valuable counterarguments. First\u00a0is that cases like Taal’s may be unique and don’t represent a national pattern. Second\u00a0is that international students are aware of America’s political climate and their universities’ policies, and study here willingly. Consequences of breaching said policies should not come as a surprise, nor should they be labeled discriminatory or persecutory.",
      "While I concede that cases like Taal’s are unique, the restrictions faced by internationals under Trump’s first presidential term weren’t. The Trump administration\u00a0initiated a 90-day travel\u00a0ban in 2017 for foreigners from Muslim countries and introduced a plethora of policy reviews for their stay duration, while attempting to eliminate\u00a0Optional Practical Training, a program that\u00a0allows international students to work in the U.S. post-graduation. Moreover, while international students enjoy protection under American law in return for acknowledging their university’s policies, they also enjoy student culture and student rights—one such right has historically been the freedom to peacefully protest. Accepting national and educational sovereignty does not exclude an international from the universal right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.",
      "Students must, in this context, rethink what activism means for them. At this point, it might be smarter and safer to create change in the background, while reducing physical protest\u00a0in the foreground. Risking one’s educational status for ideals is an admirable showcase\u00a0of conviction, but comes with danger. Finishing one’s education, accessing resources in the longer term, advocating strategically, and protecting our stay here is the path that now may provide more scope for impactful activism—as opposed to getting arrested the day of your first on-campus protest.",
      "We should stay here long enough to invoke meaningful change. Our officials, our political landscape, and our legal realities are changing. Our activism shouldn’t\u00a0shirk, but rather transform to meet this.",
      "Voicing dissent and impressing change is still possible, as it must be. Writing for on-campus publications, engaging with international student forums and bodies like Wesleyan International Speakers Program and the International Student Advisory Board, continuing conversations with family back home and diaspora in America, forming connections with faculty, organizing civic engagement workshops, and building relationships with community organizations are only some of\u00a0the ways to ensure one’s activism reaches beyond the ivory tower while sustaining one’s ability to act over time. Keeping in touch with educational immigration officials and the University’s\u00a0Office of International Student Affairs\u00a0is also key for being updated about new policies and regulations.\u00a0",
      "It may be tempting to throw in the towel, and the books, and your Wes merch-turned-souvenir, and then book a one-way flight home. The international student presence on campus brings great assets to the political culture of any institution that welcomes it, and we must remember that. There are still ways to spur change in America safely under the new administration’s dangerous policies, and it is important that we seek out these methods to ensure our voices can remain heard.",

      "Merve Emre is the Shapiro-Silverberg University Professor of Creative Writing and Criticism and the Shapiro Writing Center Director. Christian Nakarado is an assistant professor of art.",
      "The Argus: How did you two meet?",
      "Merve Emre: The first time we met was in 2010…",
      "Christian Nakarado: The first time? You’re acknowledging it?",
      "ME: When did we meet? I have a very bad memory.",
      "CN: The first time we ever actually met was in 2010 because we were both dating people who were in the medical school at Yale. We were both graduate students at Yale in different programs, and we were the only two non-med students at this barbecue. ",
      "ME: Do you know that Christian is 6’4” and I’m 5’4”? And he was dating this woman named Lydia, who was like seven feet tall. And I remember going and standing next to them and feeling like somebody’s baby because they were both so tall. It’s really my first memory of Christian—standing next to him and his gigantic girlfriend and looking, looking, looking up at them.",
      "CN: My story is that Merve continued to make eyes at me for two years after that event.",
      "ME: I never thought about him again. I still don’t really think about him.",
      "CN: But the official answer to your question is that we met in the first meeting kind of way the day after I finished architecture school. ",
      "ME: I picked him up at a bar in New Haven.",
      "CN: Yeah, she was making eyes at me as usual.",
      "ME: No, I’d never seen this man before. I walked up to him at the bar and I said, “Do we know each other?”",
      "CN: No, I said, “Hi Merve.” Because we knew each other. And then you said, “Do I know you? Have we made out?”",
      "ME: It’s a great line.",
      "A: I’m going to use that.",
      "ME: This is what your generation loses when they’re on the Hinge and the Tinder!",
      "A: Okay, and then what? Did you guys start dating after that?",
      "ME: So Christian had just gotten out of this seven-year relationship. I was always in a relationship for like six months at a time. We started seeing each other and Christian was like, “I just want this to be a really slow burn.” And I was like, “Alright, I don’t do that, so I’m leaving.” And then Christian was like, “No, don’t leave. We can definitely be in a relationship.” So that’s how I got him! I was living in New Haven and he was living in New York, and I’d go visit him. He’d say something non-committal that would piss me off and I’d pack all my bags and I’d be like, “I’m leaving!” Then I’d go to the train station and wait for him to come running after me, which was the pattern of our relationship for the first, like, year and a half until we got engaged.",
      "CN: Yeah, that’s basically right.",
      "A: Okay—so you met when you were attending this one institution, in different departments, and now you teach in the same place. I’m curious how you guys have found working and commuting at the same place.",
      "ME: Well, I don’t have a driver’s license. So I really needed to be married to someone who works at the same place that I work if that place is not within walking distance. I’m also a really great backseat driver, so I’m a joy because I contribute nothing while criticizing everything.",
      "CN: You could say that applies to all realms of your life.",
      "ME: Yeah! That’s what being a critic is: Contribute nothing while criticizing everything. Thank you, I love how you support me in my career and life. ",
      "CN: When we were first engaged, I remember Merve’s mom talking to me at some point and being like, with Gulus and Melis [Merve’s younger sisters], I understand why their boyfriends are with them. It’s very straightforward. But she was like, with Merve, you must really really love her to be able to commit to this with her. And I said in response, and I still believe this: The thing I love about being around Merve every day and being in a partnership with her is that it’s never boring. It’s exciting and wonderful, and it can also be uncomfortable and miserable sometimes, but it’s never boring. And I think of that as being something I am still very grateful for.",
      "ME: That’s great. I also think I’m perfect.",
      "A: Do you ever collaborate professionally or artistically on any projects?",
      "ME: We technically co-wrote an essay some years ago, by which I mean, I wrote the essay and let Christian put his name on it, and after that, no, we never collaborated. We do read each other’s work and give feedback on that. We talk about ideas all the time. We talk about ideas with each other, but then we also talk about ideas as a family with our kids as well. And so I actually feel like the whole life that we lead is this really big, fun, exciting, artistic collaboration. It just feels like it’s part of how we live, not something that we do in a discrete way.",
      "CN: I would say that Merve and I produce work in very different ways. One of the reasons our early collaboration was not the success it could have been was that Merve wanted it done quickly, and I produced work more slowly and less efficiently—",
      "ME: Right, so I’m responsible and conscientious, and you are self-indulgent and daydreaming.",
      "CN: Yeah, yeah. So there’s that. And in answer to your earlier question about the difficulties and joys of working at the same place, I’m actually very grateful that we work in completely different disciplines, because even though we are constantly collaborating in terms of talking about ideas, there are a lot of architects who are married to or otherwise romantically involved with, the people who they practice architecture with. It’s a profession that is non-stop, and I think adding your romantic partnership to that is a recipe for disaster. So even though we work at the same place, we think about very different things. And I’m grateful for that separation.",
      "ME: I wish I were his boss. Be honest, are we the best couple you’ve talked to?",
      "C: I would like to point out that that is kind of a replication of something that Merve did when our first son was born, because it was shortly after Jay-Z and Beyonce had donated a bunch of money to have the entire labor and delivery floor at Lenox Hill renovated so that their first child could be born there, or maybe second child. And I remember Merve in labor being like, “Am I doing better than Beyoncé?”",
      "ME: And everyone told me I was! I was doing better than Beyoncé.",
      "A: Now that you mentioned children, I’m curious how children change a married relationship.",
      "ME: 100%. In a very banal way, I think back to the kind of time that we once had to do things together, to plan things for each other, and now, you know, 95% of that goes into the children, right? I mean, that’s exciting, and it’s fun. I always say this, but I really, really, like us as a family. I think we are the best family. We are better than Beyoncé and Jay-Z and Blue Ivy and whatever other kids there are. Is there another kid?",
      "CN: I don’t know. We’re too old to know.",
      "A: Well, just right before this, I interviewed Jay-Z and Beyoncé, and they were actually asking about you two. Do students realize that you’re married? Is that something you hear much?",
      "ME: I don’t know what you all know. I barely know if you’ve done the reading. ",
      "A: Just one final question I’ve been asking everyone at the end: What is something you admire about the other?",
      "ME: I love that Christian has a driver’s license, and I feel like I’ve been really consistent about that since the beginning of this conversation. No, I love how patient he is. This is the flip side of what we were joking about, doing work in a slower way. I find that slowness translates, in our family dynamics, to him being very patient with me and with the kids, particularly in a situation where someone is getting agitated or having trouble expressing an emotion. Christian has all the patience in the world to wait for somebody to articulate what they are feeling and to calm them down. I’m very impatient, and I want answers quickly, and I want things done efficiently. That is not always the best way to be in a situation where people need to feel like they have time. Now you say something nice.",
      "CN: Merve is maybe the person I’ve been around in my life that is the most alive. She’s the most alive person I’ve ever encountered. ",
      "ME: Christian mostly hangs out with zombies. ",
      "CN: I mean, I guess this is another way of saying the thing that I said to her mom, that I already told you the story about, but it’s life-affirming to be really passionate and energized and to be around someone who is like that, even sometimes when things are volatile or going too fast for my tastes, or even sometimes difficult or unpleasant. I think there’s some kind of affirmation of life in that, which I really love. Maybe it’s very clear to you already that in our best moments as a couple, we really balance each other. And clearly, if I’m going too slowly. I could really use someone to tell me to speed up, and I’m grateful for her being that presence in my life and in our family.",

      "Scott Holmes is a professor of molecular biology and biochemistry and integrative sciences. Amy MacQueen is an associate professor of molecular biology and biochemistry and integrative sciences.",
      "The Argus: Your bookshelves are full of travel books! Tell me about your adventures.",
      "Scott Holmes: Amy’s from New Hampshire, so she likes hiking in the White Mountains, and she’s been doing it forever. ",
      "Amy MacQueen: Since my daughter was five, we’ve done the Presidential Range every year. You do three huts and go across the eight Presidentials.",
      "A: Wow, with a five-year-old.",
      "AM: She’s very proud of herself. She’s actually applied to work at the huts this year. And my son went along with us as well. It became a real thing, so Scott would join us, too. He loves to hike as well. ",
      "SH: Our ideal trip includes some culture, some family, some getting out, and doing something active.",
      "AM: Scott’s family is wonderful in this way because his mother also really likes to learn. She’s much older, but she organizes trips. We had a similar trip two years ago to Greece, where we were truffle hunting in the woods. That’s a lot of what resonates with us, we’re always like we were when we were five—just learning and playing. That’s the other thing: we both run. I think one of the first things we did together was a race in Denver. There’s the research and the outdoors, and the play, and [we] became best friends.",
      "A: You’ve been living in this house for three years now?",
      "AM: I raised my kids [from my first marriage] in Durham, N.C. But I didn’t like having to drive to work. So we were looking, especially once both my kids were on their way to college. And buying this house—I don’t know if you know this, but we’re not married, not that we might never get married—but buying this house was that kind of solidification. This was really a romantic endeavor.",
      "A: I’m curious if you could talk about the process of working in the same department and then dating and now living together. How has that changed your relationship?",
      "AM: It’s really nice to be able to share downtime. I used to think it was great to have amazing experiences; once in a while, we could get together for a trip here or a hike there. But it’s really nice to not have to pack everything into one thing, just to have [some] downtime. I think Scott’s self-conscious because I love being alone—I’m really an alone person. He’s more of a party animal and likes being with people. He’s always asking, “Is it okay that I’m here? Why are you always with me if you like being alone?” But it’s just different. It’s really nice to just co-exist through the ups and downs of daily routine.",
      "SH: We often walk over together, and come back. And that’s not always true, it’s not like we’re right on top of each other during the day. So there’s a little bit of a separate world there that’s actually going to diminish when we move into the new building, where our two labs are going to be [adjoining].",
      "A: I’m curious about what it’s been like to find a close romantic affinity for a second time in life, and to find it at an older age now.",
      "AM: It’s the best. I want to tell my kids, “Don’t bother with a relationship until you’re 40.” Well, you should bother. But just like in junior high or high school, it’s nice to have different friends. Sometimes you keep all your friends, sometimes you pair off, and things don’t work out. In your 20s and 30s, you have ambitions. You don’t know which partnership will work. There’s always a two-body problem (the complications when a couple are both in academia). You don’t know everything. By your 40s, you kind of do. My mindset hasn’t changed, but in terms of a domestic relationship, you know yourself more after figuring out your career. You fall in love, but that doesn’t mean it works forever. Or you fall in love because it looks right on paper, you’re great friends, but the chemistry isn’t right. After college, you’re supposed to just know. If you get married, you’re supposed to know. But it’s never that way. It doesn’t make sense scientifically. Relationships change. It’s nice when you’ve figured out your life a little more.",
      "SH: I don’t think you do all the learning you’re talking about if you’re not with a partner. You can’t just hold off. ",
      "AM: That’s the thing—not to diminish relationships at all stages. But I get distressed when I read my kids these books, and they’re disdainful of relationships that broke off. The worst thing was for your parents to get a divorce. That’s not nuanced or forgiving enough. It’s not looking at reality the way it is. If we can embrace that sometimes things don’t work out, but you still support each other—I feel like I’m very liberal with that. You’re learning from all of that. I don’t think we’d redo anything differently, actually, would you agree?",
      "SH: You’re forming yourself along the way. A little later in life, you have more perspective on yourself and what’s important to you. But it’s not like then you know exactly what you want, because the next person you meet is going to change what you thought you wanted.",
      "AM: And I think I definitely was not as able to be vulnerable with somebody else in my 20s. I was very happy, but very much a loner and very ambitious. I knew exactly where I was going, and I knew what I wanted. I did what I wanted, and things worked out. But then I remember being in a situation where I was like, “Wait a second, I’m actually not happy in this relationship.” And that was a shocker because it was [with] my best friend at the time, but it wasn’t working. So I feel like I did grow as a person in terms of being able to connect to someone in a way that was going to be fulfilling for me in the end. There is still growing time, even though I do still feel like I’m the same as I was when I was five years old.",
      "A: What are some of the practical things you two have realized you’re looking for? ",
      "AM: I think I’m drawn to other scientists—I just love to talk about our work. But it is true that it might be a little tricky if I’m in the lab until 11, and someone doesn’t understand why. I really like the fact that Scott doesn’t really care that much about dinner. That’s really great, because I think dinner is so overrated. And you’re so tired at the end of the day, you don’t want to really cook anything. Sometimes we just have cheese and crackers for dinner, and it’s really good.",
      "A: You mentioned marriage earlier. Have you thought about or discussed it much?",
      "AM: I’ll tell you honestly, we haven’t had the time. I love a big party. If I’m gonna have a wedding, it’s gonna be a really fun party. We had a really good Thanksgiving, but it hasn’t really worked out that we’ve suddenly gotten married at one of those parties.",

    content: [
      "According to University Network for Human Rights (UNHR) senior faculty, they have still not received a formal decision from Wesleyan University on whether their partnership will continue.",
      "UNHR is the operating organization that implements the Human Rights Advocacy Minor’s (HRAM) curriculum and its practical fieldwork. In late 2024, the University expressed contractual concerns regarding its relationship with UNHR, which is up for renewal at the end of\u00a0the spring semester. UNHR has responded to the administrators’ concerns with a proposal.",
      "However, according to HRAM Co-Chair and Professor of Philosophy Stephen Angle, President Michael Roth ’78 communicated in an informal meeting on Friday, Jan. 17, his decision to end the relationship with UNHR. In email communications with The Argus, Roth denied that any formal decision was made. In the following week, as students mobilized to protect the relationship, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Nicole Stanton echoed this sentiment, adding that the University is committed to continuing the HRAM program with its key features intact.",
      "Since receiving an email confirmation two weeks ago on Jan. 23, faculty and students have expressed frustration at continued delays and lack of communication from the administration regarding a formal decision on the partnership.",
      "On Feb. 4, a Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) referendum titled “Protecting the Partnership Between the University Network for Human Rights and the Human Rights Advocacy Minor at Wesleyan” passed with 97% support out of a total of 812 votes.",
      "Over the past week, student organizers mobilized strongly to publicize the referendum to the larger student body by utilizing social media and tabling at Usdan University Center. Student organizers hoped that the referendum’s positive results would urge the University to renew its three-year contract with UNHR.",
      "“Despite this strong student support, we are concerned the University has not communicated with the UNHR transparently or engaged in meaningful negotiation,” WSA senator and sponsor of Resolution 3.46 on protecting the University’s human rights program Zain Punjwani ’26 said. “Until the university shows us through action that they are committed to negotiating with the UNHR in good faith, we remain committed to exploring all avenues of advocacy to ensure our support for this partnership is heard.”",
      "While the administration has conveyed that the referendum result has strongly prompted them to formulate a solution, it will not affect any ultimate decision they have to make on the basis of contractual factors.",
      "“There are two really significant legal and financial issues that make the relationship as it is now unsustainable,” Provost Stanton said. “Those are not things that students are a part of deciding or voting on, because they’re not liable. Those have to be resolved in a way that results in a safe and sustainable program correct for our students. So, regardless of any referendum, it’s our job to provide a safe and sustainable experience.”",
      "Nevertheless, HRAM faculty leaders and Wesleyan University’s administrators have made some successful contact. On Monday, Feb. 3, Angle met with Stanton to discuss the future of the minor.",
      "“I had a constructive meeting with Provost Stanton [on Feb. 3], and we’re continuing to work on achieving what she has said are her goals: maintaining the Human Rights Advocacy Minor with all of its key features intact,” Angle wrote in an email to The Argus. “There are several steps left, but I hope that within a week or two we’ll have worked out the details in a way that is satisfactory to all parties.”",
      "On Tuesday, Feb. 4, in a regular faculty meeting, Stanton acknowledged that faculty members expressed interest in the ongoing decision-making process of the University’s partnership with UNHR and conveyed that the administration is open to faculty concerns. Provost Stanton reaffirmed her stance that the University’s current relationship with UNHR is unsustainable and that the administration is committed to figuring out a new path forward.",
      "In an email to The Argus, John E. Andrus Professor of Government and Department Chair Mary Alice Haddad shared that many of her department’s students and faculty have been involved in the work of the UNHR, which has expanded the government curriculum’s scope beyond what would be possible with just the regular faculty’s support.",
      "“I had not realized that the contract with UNHR was up for renewal,” Haddad wrote. “Since I’m Chair of a unit with such close contact with UNHR, it would have been nice if I had been contacted earlier to be part of the conversations about how to craft a new, improved relationship with them.”",
      "Student organizers and student members of Wesleyan University’s Educational Policy Committee (EPC) conveyed that they viewed faculty interest as an avenue to encourage transparent University communication regarding the future of the partnership, the HRAM program, and general decisions made by administrators.",
      "According to UNHR Director of Programs and Senior Clinical Supervisor Tamar Hayrikyan, witnessing faculty interest and support has been reassuring to UNHR.",
      "“I see individual faculty members finding ways to be kind of an interface between us and the administration in a kind of sincere, concerned way, almost helping to compensate for the fact that we aren’t really getting that direct interface with the administration,” Hayrikyan wrote in an email to The Argus.",
      "For current students in the HRAM and prospective students in the introductory class titled “Human Rights Standards” (CSPL 228), the uncertain nature of the partnership is impacting their ongoing and potential experiences in the minor.",
      "As university administration works on formulating and delivering an official decision on its partnership with UNHR, the Advocacy and Community-based Training Semester (ACTS) program—through which students from partner institutions study human rights fact-finding, documentation, and advocacy under UNHR supervision—faces a particularly precarious situation. A critical part of the HRAM and key contractual point in UNHR and the University’s partnership, the ACTS program helps achieve a cost-neutral goal for the partnership. Any hindrance to such a goal due to the lack of clarity on the program’s status can put UNHR in non-compliance with the contract.",
      "Hayrikyan expressed the organization’s concerns about the current status of the ACTS program.",
      "“The absence of a clear decision on the timeline for phasing out this partnership, or whether or not it will be phased out at all is critical for the ACTS program,” Hayrikyan said.",
      "Hayrikyan expressed that currently, the ACTS program is designed to be ramped up over each semester, with increased numbers of students from other universities pursuing the human rights program at Wesleyan. According to her assessment based on the expressions of interest and applications UNHR has received, the ACTS program is at an inflection point, with a significant increase in enrollment this coming semester. Without a clear decision in these coming months, UNHR’s recruitment of students from other universities is severely compromised.",
      "“We will lose that momentum,” Hayrikyan said. “We are potentially already losing that momentum because we have to hold off on recruitment–we don’t know if there will be a WesACTS program next year.”",
      "Stanton has hinted that the ACTS program will be changed, but has also added that the extent of changes falls beyond her scope. The future of HRAM is not be a unilateral decision anyone in Academic Affairs could make but instead will involve working with the HRAM’s faculty advisory board.",
      "UNHR administrators expressed that would like to see more support from the University in administering the ACTS program.",
      "“The communication between Wesleyan and partner universities has not been ideal,” Hayrikyan wrote in an email to the Argus. “As a result, UNHR has had to fill gaps and fulfill student needs, like making sure they get their financial aid transferred, that they get registered and set up in Wesleyan’s system in time for the start of classes, and that housing, transfer of credits, and so on, all work out. So I hope that among those changes that would happen to the ACTS program is an improvement in the efficiency of communication and administrative procedures between Wesleyan and partner universities.”",
      "Echoing this sentiment, UNHR Executive Director and HRAM Steering Committee Co-Chair Jim Cavallaro shared that additional assistance from Wesleyan for the ACTS program was among the items which UNHR wanted to renegotiate and had conveyed to the administration in Dec. 2024.",
      "“This process has been very stressful for all of us at UNHR,” Cavallaro wrote in a message to the Argus. “The administration now says that they want to continue the Human Rights Advocacy Minor and the ACTS program with UNHR in some form. We look forward to negotiating with them, centering the interests of Wesleyan students and the communities that we serve.”",
      "Nevertheless, Hayrikyan emphasized that UNHR continue to work amid uncertainty and negotiations that affect both their everyday work and personal lives.",
      "“Every UNHR staff and faculty member is operating on three levels of reality simultaneously,” Hayrikyan said. “There is the one where just on a regular day without this, we’re constantly putting out fires and preparing people for stressful, challenging situations, whether they’re students, supervisors, teachers, communication staff, researchers—and that has not changed. The other plane of existence is planning; we’re all individuals who might lose our jobs, at least in the short term. Some of us live here, because of the partnership with Wesleyan. So there’s going to be an important upheaval in our personal lives because of this.”",
      "At the same time, UNHR reaffirms its existence as an organization with connections and a vision beyond its contract with Wesleyan.",
      "“And the third plane is, we’re mobilizing ourselves to think bigger than our partnership with Wesleyan,” Hayrikyan said. “This is a reminder that we are the University Network for Human Rights.”",
      "Student organizers stressed that protection of UNHR as the HRAM’s key operator is at the heart of their mobilization.",
      "“Transitioning to Wesleyan, I would not have had the same experience without the UNHR,” Williams College student and ACTS participant Savannah Slater ’26 said.",
      "Reflecting on two weeks of organization—from communicating with the administration and passing a WSA resolution to encouraging votes for the referendum and spreading awareness on social media—student organizers convey that their work is not complete until transparent communications and negotiations between the University and UNHR come to fruition.",
      "“I think the outpouring of support and the levels of mobilization we’ve achieved in such a short time is a testament to both how well this program has trained us to apply our skills to advocate for what we believe in, and also how much this program touched people from all corners of the campus,” student organizer Kaori Sakurai ’25 said.",
      "Many students shared that their level of commitment to this mobilization is directly related to the importance of UNHR, as the UNHR provides a safe communal space for student activists and learners, beyond just an educational environment.",
      "“The UNHR has done great support for a lot of identity clubs on-campus,”  HRAM student and WSA senator Andrea Herrera ’27, who also sponsored WSA’s Resolution 3.46, said. “This past year, the QuestBridge chapter needed a place to host their Thanksgiving event. And everything else was closed on campus…. And UNHR was willing to open its doors and [Cavallaro] even offered to buy us food with his own money to make sure that we were fed those days.”",
      "Similarly, Slater spoke positively her experience in the ACTS program this past semester.",
      "“Our classroom was a house,” Slater said, referring to the UNHR house at 101 High Street. “They [staff] stayed in the house so we could ask them questions whenever. It wasn’t just a space for learning, it was a space for community.”",
      "Cognizant of the activism HRAM students have expressed supporting both the program, UNHR faculty stressed that all organization is resultant of the students’ own passions and demands.",
      "“We teach human rights, we teach advocacy, we teach advocacy skills,” Hayrikyan said. “They use those skills. They look to us for advocacy advice as well. But they’re driving that ship, and it’s really important to me and I think to my colleagues that we let them drive that ship and let this be their fight.”",
      "Despite initial communication problems, both UNHR and Wesleyan’s administration have expressed a strong commitment to preserving the HRAM as a positive experience for students, as their partnership contract undergoes negotiations. Students will be attending an open session with Stanton and Dean of the Social Sciences Mary-Jane Rubenstein at Beckham Hall on Wednesday, Feb. 19, to continue the ongoing conversations with a broader audience. HRAM students hope that administrators will reaffirm UNHR’s involvement in future operations of the minor.",

      "Days before the Spring semester began, members of Wesleyan University’s Human Rights Advocacy Minor (HRAM) received communication about the potential dissolution of the program’s contract with the University Network for Human Rights (UNHR), an external organization based in Middletown, C.T., focusing on the study and practice of global advocacy.",
      "After conversations with the administration about contractual issues within the academic minor, HRAM Steering Committee Co-Chair Stephen Angle set up a meeting with President Michael Roth ’78.",
      "“My understanding of what [President Roth] said, rather clearly, was that he had decided to end the relationship with UNHR,” Angle said.",
      "UNHR began HRAM as a pilot program on a three-year contract with Wesleyan in 2021. As new academic programs are subject to review by the Educational Policy Committee (EPC), the EPC renewed the minor’s curriculum for another three years in May 2024. Under the partnership agreement, UNHR directs the administration and curriculum implementation of the minor.",
      "The Room Where It Happened",
      "UNHR Executive Director and HRAM Steering Committee Co-Chair James Cavallaro attested that Wesleyan administration had formally informed him of their specific concerns in an email on Jan. 10. Administrators had previously expressed general worries regarding their partnership with UNHR in a Dec. 16 meeting that included Angle.",
      "Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Nicole Stanton declined to comment on specific aspects of the contract, but noted that there have been conversations going back several months concerning the ongoing logistical, financial, and liability challenges regarding the relationship between UNHR and Wesleyan.",
      "“Throughout the course of the partnership, we made agreements about things that were going to happen, and they have not happened,” Stanton said. “We do feel like [it has] put our students and the institution at risk, and we have not been able to solve these problems.”",
      "According to Cavallaro, Wesleyan administrators noted the UNHR’s lack of communication regarding the program’s fieldwork locations during the 2024 Fall semester, as well as failure to perform background checks on external UNHR supervisors, but the program had articulated their intention to settle the concerns.",
      "“I don’t understand what’s happening here,” Cavallaro said. “We were negotiating. [Stanton] raised concerns. It took three weeks to put them in writing to us, and when she raised the concerns, we immediately expressed our interest in resolving them as quickly as possible.”",
      "Cavallaro stated that, in past semesters, UNHR had properly communicated these locations, and the core team of UNHR supervisors which were appointed as Wesleyan instructors had undergone required Wesleyan-required background checks, although some secondary supervisors, such as local contacts for programming in foreign countries, had not.",
      "“[Wesleyan] pulled the rug out from under us,” Cavallaro said. “They’re minor fixes. We’ve been in a relationship for years.”",
      "Cavallaro told The Argus that he had delivered Stanton a written proposal addressing these concerns on Jan. 13 2025, asking how to initiate the Wesleyan background check process and providing greater administrative communication with Wesleyan. He has not yet received a response.",
      "UNHR also requested a formal decision from Stanton and Dean of the Social Sciences Mary-Jane Rubenstein on the status of the partnership. As of Friday, Jan. 31 2025, the parties have not reached a resolution. Stanton acknowledged the lack of a concrete plan regarding the future of a hypothetical HRAM without a partnership with UNHR.",
      "“There’s some expertise we don’t have in-house,” Stanton said. “I would want to go to the faculty who developed the minor and see what they think.”",
      "Angle and Stanton plan to have a meeting on Monday, Feb. 3, for further conversation on UNHR’s partnership with Wesleyan.",
      "Student Advocacy and Mobilization",
      "Beginning on Thursday, Jan. 23, HRAM students and other student activists mobilized in support of protecting the partnership. Students conducted an informal organizational session at the Human Rights House on Saturday, Jan. 25, concluding with a call for students to participate in substantive action items in the following days.",
      "“I came to Wesleyan…primarily because they offered [HRAM],” Zain Punjwani ’26 said.\u00a0 “I completed my coursework with the core required courses for the minor last year, and to even just see it at risk is just awful, because it played such an important part in shaping my views.”",
      "Students met with Stanton both during and outside of her office hours, waiting for the opportunity to discuss the decision. Paul Quach ’26, Andrea Herrera ’27, and Punjwani, all of whom serve as senators on the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA), sponsored Resolution 3.46: Protecting the Existence of the University Network for Human Rights’ Human Rights Advocacy Program at Wesleyan University. The resolution highlighted the unique nature of HRAM as the only program of its kind in the United States, providing law school-quality human rights training to undergraduate students. The proposal also reiterated the rationale behind the EPC’s decision to renew the program.",
      "In the Sunday, Jan. 26 WSA meeting, over a dozen students spoke in support of the resolution, testifying to the impact HRAM had on them. A frequently raised point was that UNHR was crucial to HRAM, and that the minor could not exist in its current state without the partnership.",
      "Several students from partner universities participating in HRAM’s Advocacy and Community-based Training Semester (ACTS)—a program focusing on human rights fact-finding, documentation, and advocacy under UNHR supervision—testified that the ongoing uncertainty around the partnership has deterred applications to ACTS in their home schools.",
      "“[ACTS] nearly convinced me to transfer to Wesleyan for my last semester,” Wellesley College student and ACTS participant Emma Cohen wrote in an email to The Argus. “The reason this program changed my life, and the thing that makes it all that it is, are UNHR staff members.”",
      "The WSA unanimously voted to approve Resolution 3.46 and opened the “Referendum on Protecting the Partnership Between the University Network for Human Rights and the Human Rights Advocacy Minor at Wesleyan” on Jan. 26. The referendum will be open and accessible for Wesleyan students to vote on until Sunday, Feb. 2.\u00a0",
      "Student organizers created an Instagram account, @save_human_rights_at_wesleyan, intended to highlight key issues of discontent, including the argument that HRAM cannot exist without UNHR, and to share updates about the WSA referendum.",
      "“The overwhelming student support…[has been] tremendously moving…whatever happens here, I feel totally validated,” Cavallaro said.\u00a0",
      "Responding to the breadth of student organization, Stanton sent an email on Wednesday, Jan. 29 to HRAM minors, inviting students to an open session with herself and Rubenstein on Wednesday, Feb. 19.",
      "HRAM minor Kaori Sakurai ’25 responded to Stanton on behalf of her fellow UNHR students.",
      "“Prolonging the uncertainty around this issue is causing considerable damage to the existing human rights programming,” Sakurai wrote. “This disruption to enrollment puts the future of this program in serious jeopardy. As the ACTS program provides a major source of funding for UNHR Human Rights program, losing the ACTS program would seriously damage the financial viability of the minor.”",
      "According to Roth, Wesleyan has not yet made a formal decision on the future of the partnership. Stanton similarly reiterated that the academic minor, as approved by the EPC, will continue.\u00a0",
      "“We remain committed to the study of human rights at Wesleyan, the Human Rights minor, [and] making sure students get the most wonderful, rich, safe experience that we can provide,” Stanton said. “At this moment in time, I cannot imagine a more important field of study than human rights.”",

      "In 2023, the Shapiro Center for Writing began an internship program for students at the University under Shapiro Center Director and Professor of Creative Writing Merve Emre. The program began with one internship for a student at The New York Review of Books and has quickly expanded to a broad range of media and publishing agencies, including Farrar, Straus and Giroux; The Borchardt Agency; Janklow & Nesbit Associates; and Archipelago Books.",
      "Many of these institutions are owned or managed by alumni, something that Emre stated was an important part of establishing these internships. These internships have helped the Shapiro Center to develop fruitful collaborations with departments at the University and beyond as the center continues to grow.",
      "“I am proud of how we’ve grown and how well we’ve managed to work with partner centers, like [the Gordon Career Center], and other organizations.” Emre wrote in an email to The Argus. “This has allowed us to create employment opportunities for students and direct resources to arts and media organizations that desperately need them. This summer, for instance, we will work with the Center for the Humanities and the Connecticut Humanities Council to establish eight fully funded summer internships at Connecticut-based newspapers to help support local journalism.”",
      "In addition to the sponsored internships, Emre also connected interested students with other publications like The Dial and the Academy of American Poets and directed them to the Gordon Career Center to apply for funding separately.",
      "Three of this year’s recipients, Sophie Jager ’25, Mia Foster ’25, and Carolyn Neugarten ’26, reflected on their experiences working as publishing interns for the summer at the “Ask Us Anything” session on Oct. 16. The students served as panelists, answering questions about the application process, the internship experiences, and the publishing industry. Emre reflected on how the event highlighted how the internships honed the panelists’ developed skills.",
      "“I was impressed by how much they had learned.” Emre wrote. “They spoke with tremendous authority and ambition about the fields of contemporary fiction, criticism, and reporting, and they displayed an amazing independence of judgment.”",
      "This confidence, which the interns derived from in-field experience, is something they uniquely attributed to the Shapiro Center, focusing on the role of literary departments at liberal arts universities in the wider, transitionary literary world.",
      "“I think the real difference between the Shapiro Center, under Professor Emre and other departments on campus, is that the Shapiro Center is really focused on not just talking about great literature, but really giving students real things to do with their degrees in literature,” Jager said.",
      "Foster, who interned with Farrar, Straus and Giroux this summer, was already connected to the Shapiro Center through her involvement in the Lavender, her founding of the Wesleyan Review of Books, and her classes. These experiences helped expose her to the internships.",
      "“I was really lucky and I took a writing center cross-listed [College of Letters] class called ‘Love and Other Useless Pursuits’ (WRCT 304) with Professor Emre when she’d just arrived here,” Foster said. “She was really helpful and supportive creating these new opportunities at the Center, and I feel like because I knew her, I knew these things were happening…. I feel like I live there now.”",
      "Foster felt that the internship was made easier by her experiences working on campus publications as managing editor for the Lavender and as a member of the editorial board of Fray Magazine.",
      "“I have loved working on publications on campus.” Foster said. “I think it’s how I have met so many creative people I would not have met otherwise, like Fray Magazine…. Working on a literary magazine is very cool, they have an open editorial board—which is impossible to have in the real world—so I really treasure that for the freedom we have. These experiences have really allowed me to move through these professional worlds that I wouldn’t have been able to, if I didn’t have the maybe less-professional experience of working on a campus publication.”",
      "Neugarten was drawn to interning at the New York Review of Books by the publication’s James Joyce series. She emphasized the novelty and uniqueness of the experience as well, despite her prior experiences at corporate internships.",
      "“It was really something I’d never done before,” Neugarten said. “Getting to work on a magazine staff, where everyone is a) friendlier and b) more attuned to current events and conversations was very fun.”",
      "The internships gave recipients an opportunity to explore different avenues of working in the literary world. Jager, who interned for Janklow & Nesbit Associates, talked about getting her foot in the door of the wider writing scene by learning more about agenting and marketing.",
      "“I think Janklow ended up being a really good fit for what I needed to learn this summer,” Jager said. “I think agenting is a very interesting part of the literary scene that people don’t think about. Understanding how much of it is a market in that sense was really eye-opening for me.”",
      "Jager has had experience in political writing and communications work in the past few years, including digital producing for political campaigns in Vermont, but the internship introduced her to a new way of assessing writing.",
      "“This was a very different test of my ability to write.” Jager said. “It was less about how good I am as a writer, but really about understanding what makes writing good. Being able to look at something and not just saying, ‘This is good writing, or this is bad writing,’ but being able to look at it and say, ‘This is why it’s good, or this is why it needs this to make it good.’ The better of a writer I become, the harder I understand that writing is.”",
      "Foster also detailed how evaluating manuscripts at the internship had more to do with understanding taste than anything else.",
      "“I ended up doing a lot of reading of manuscripts,” Foster said. “You read however much you’re compelled to read of the book, you write a summary of the book…giving a framing way to enter the work without having to read it. Your specific taste is the most important thing. The reason that they’re hiring you is because you have this particular perspective. Taste was a huge part for who I got paired with for my editors, and the way I was learning their taste and taking that on.”",
      "Jager echoed the need for assessing reading tastes, but emphasized the importance of being able to detach one’s own inclinations where necessary.",
      "“I think my taste was pretty much on the back burner,” Jager said. “A big part of my job was evaluating manuscripts clients sent it. I was lucky in that I liked a lot of the same stuff Melissa and Emma did. But it was really learning how to read a piece of writing and decide whether they would be interested in it.”",
      "Through her internship, Neugarten was able to participate in the daily operations of the magazine as well, including fielding book requests, copy editing, and image sourcing. She talked about how it aligned with her interest in covering contemporary affairs and her future aspirations.",
      "“I really appreciate that the New York Review of Books does current events and news-style things as well,” Neugarten said. “They have the magazine end where they’re discussing books, film, art, but they also do the election. I remember copy-editing a piece about the U.K. elections. Careerwise, I’m definitely interested in business reporting, and the New York Review of Books assisted in that. I was able to read some of their more economic pieces.”",
      "Interns were exposed to multiple aspects of publication through the internships.",
      "“The best, most fun part was that I received training from the fact-checker and copy-editor on staff.” Neugarten said. “I had actually never fact-checked before. Understanding the nuances of double checking sources, corresponding with the author that what’s being communicated is being effectively communicated through the writing—it was just really fun.”",
      "Foster recommends that students interested in reading, writing, and the humanities get involved with the Shapiro Center.",
      "“I would definitely encourage people to take advantage of all the opportunities and events the Writing Center is putting on,” Foster said. “There’s lunches with alumni, a million talks, and all these different opportunities to learn what turning an inapplicable thing into an actual job looks like. I’ve been really lucky to have working opportunities to know what this world looks like.”",
      "Advising any future applicants, the three panelists all recommended knowing the publications they’d be applying to intimately.",
      "“Knowing the publications you’re applying to is the most important part of your application,” Foster said. “It’s important for you to understand them, and for them to understand you.”",
      "Emre advised future applicants to think about the kind of literature and criticism that gives them pleasure and to connect it to what they may be interested in covering.",
      "“Think about what issues you would like to report on, and why they matter to you.” Emre wrote. “Read!”",

      "Walking past Olin Library any evening in the past few weeks, it would be impossible to miss the spectrum of colors throwing light onto the pillars of the building’s front facade. This display is credited to Mario Torres, DJ and long-time mover for Physical Plant, and his student assistant Harmony Hoogs ’27, who set up the lighting to celebrate\u00a0Pride Month at the University. Every night from Oct. 23 to Oct. 31, Torres and Hoogs illuminated the library from 6:30 p.m. to 12 a.m.",
      "Torres uses his personal company, Powered by 2 DJ’s, to hire students like Hoogs to help set up for events. His company has existed for 25 years, but Torres has been DJing for much longer. From hip-hop and soca to reggae and latin, he has more than 38 years of DJ experience under his belt. His favorite music genre to date, however, is house music. Originally from Brooklyn,\u00a0N.Y.,\u00a0he moved to Connecticut after getting married.",
      "Torres started off working at the RIDE at the University, but he is now the resident DJ for many on-campus events, including the senior dance, seasonal fairs, the ice cream socials, and provides lighting for photo booths. He also gives tours of the campus underground tunnels. In 2021 he won the Peter Morgenstern-Clarren ’03 Employee Recognition Prize for his dedicated work at the University. A well-traveled musician in his younger years, Torres has played across the country and beyond, stopping in Texas, Florida, New York, and Canada. It’s this diverse experience in music that he brings to his work as a DJ at the University.",
      "While this was Torres’s first time lighting up Olin for Pride Month, he has a long history of lighting up buildings, both at the University and beyond.",
      "“I see a building that looks beautiful, and I think the architecture would look really good if I light it up,” Torres said. “I did Wadsworth Mansion, Zelnick (Pavillion), I did the back of Olin once too. And then there’s a lot of places in New York that I light up too. ”\u00a0",
      "When it comes to his DJ gigs, Torres is just as enthusiastic.",
      "“I treat every event like my first, I don’t pick and choose. Really, I give it my all,” he said, remembering all the events he’s DJed for so far.",
      "He strongly emphasized the support of Physical Plant in coordinating event support on campus.\u00a0",
      "“I also have Physical Plant members who help me out,” Torres said. “It depends on the event, but mostly the electricians, my coworkers, help us out.”",
      "Torres also brought attention to the Forklift Danceworks program, of which Hoogs was a part of in her first year. Visiting Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Kathleen Miller’s “Introduction to Environmental Studies” (ENVS197) class collaborates with the non-profit Forklift Danceworks, which allows enrolled students to do a collaborative project for their final. The program, which has been around for eight years, pairs students individually with a Physical Plant employee to shadow their work; Hoogs was paired with Torres. She shadowed Torres as he responded to Physical Plant work orders under the program, and this year she helped set up, stage, and break down the lighting for Olin.\u00a0",
      "Hoogs talked about her experience working with lighting for the first time.\u00a0",
      "“Honestly, I’ve never done anything technical like lighting before, but getting into it has been really fun,” Hoogs said. “It’s really cool to be working at midnight, and I get to watch everyone leaving the library. They look at me like ‘What the hell are you doing?’ and I say ‘Hey, I’m on the clock right now.’”",
      "Hoogs is one of many students Torres has worked with over the years. He reflected on his personal history, noting the importance of programs like Forklift Danceworks for bringing different communities on campus together.\u00a0",
      "“The students have always been great; that’s why I work with the students,” Torres said.\u00a0“They’re always eager to learn, they’re always coming up to me when I’m DJing. They want to learn about the music, and how to be a DJ. But that’s what the Forklift does, it bridges the gap between Physical Plant and the students.”",
      "He believes that there’s some apprehension from students in approaching Physical Plant or sending in work orders, but that there’s really no reason for it.\u00a0",
      "“Students are worried to reach out to Physical Plant sometimes,” Torres said. “We’ll fix your bed, we’ll fix your thermostat, we’ll fix your blinds. They should reach out.”",

      "Office Hours With Professor Norman Danner: Program Analysis, Bagel Baking, and the Art of Sitting in Front of a Computer",
    date: "October 28, 2024",
    authors: "Janhavi Munde",
    images: [],
    content: [
      "Professor of Computer Science Norman Danner has taught at Wesleyan for 22 years. Any computer science major will indubitably take a course with Danner, and he has seen the University design, develop, and hone its scientific curriculum. Over the course of his time here, he has contributed much to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department—the combined nature of which is one of the last of its kind. The Argus sat down with him to talk about his current research, the University’s unique teaching approach for computer science, and his hobbies.\u00a0",
      "Argus:\u00a0What is your favorite class you have taught here?",
      "Norman Danner: Different classes are fun for different reasons, so I still enjoy teaching my [“Computer Science I”] (COMP211) class. I enjoy that material. Right now I am teaching a class, “Program Analysis” (COMP324), and since it’s my second time teaching it, I’m still learning material myself, which makes it a lot of fun for me.\u00a0",
      "A:\u00a0What do you think is a surprising hobby of yours?",
      "ND: I don’t know if anybody would find the things I do to be all that surprising. The main hobby I have these days is baking bread. I still bake fairly basic stuff, ordinary loaves of bread, but also bagels. Bagels are my favorite.\u00a0",
      "A:\u00a0Pivoting to your teaching, I’ve heard from many computer science majors that the department is in need of more professors. Do you have any thoughts about that?",
      "ND: Like most departments, almost all of us need more faculty. I mean, computer science has had a dramatic increase over the last ten years or so in the number of students. 12–13 years ago there were nine students graduating in that senior class year. Now we have about 60 students. And this is a national trend. And honestly, you know, the administration has brought us up from five faculty members—when I arrived here I was the fifth permanent faculty member—and now we have seven, and are working on hiring an eighth. The class sizes are 25–30 students, sometimes larger. So, yes, we need more faculty, but I do think the administration has allowed us to expand.\u00a0",
      "A: Do you think, because of the drastic increase of interest in computer science, universities have expanded the topics they’re teaching?\u00a0",
      "ND: Universities in general, I can’t really answer. Wesleyan has done that, in hiring new faculty. When I was hired at Wesleyan, the kind of work we did tended to be very foundational. And, you know, for the last few hires, we’ve focused on broadening the research profile. So hiring people like Professor [Victoria] Manfredi for networks, Professor [Sonia] Roberts for robotics, Professor [Sebastian] Zimmeck for privacy and security. We’ve really tried to move in this direction; we felt that it was time where we could reasonably do that. It’s better for students to also get a broader range of those kinds of classes.\u00a0",
      "A: How do you think the University supports the\u00a0Mathematics\u00a0and\u00a0Computer Science\u00a0Department? I don’t think I know of many other universities that group math and computer science.\u00a0",
      "ND: It used to be much more common. A lot of computer science departments grew out of math departments. The question does come up, as we are one of the last research universities to have that combined department. We just haven’t chosen to split up. We haven’t seen a need to. We all get along very well and there’s a certain amount of research-level interactions between mathematicians and computer scientists. But I think the administration, for the most part, has supported us.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "A: That makes sense, especially since so many people fall in the cross-section of math and computer science.",
      "ND: The department still supports that. Even while broadening out the research profile of the department, we still have a really strong perspective that the foundations of computer science enable the more applied areas to function. So when you talk to our faculties, who are in those applied areas, the grounding in the foundations is still absolutely paramount. That is what I think makes Wesleyan’s computer science different from other small computer science programs. That is also what’s really important to our foundational gateway sequence, which is the ethos of how we understand computer science, both in terms of research and education.\u00a0",
      "A: Speaking of research, could you talk about your two research interests: practical programming languages, and—I’m going to try very hard to get this right—automated extractions of\u00a0cost information from program source code?\u00a0",
      "ND: Unfortunately, I have not updated my research profile online. So we get to skip most of that. Those were old research programs, practical languages for feasible computing. Generally, an important issue in computing is after you know your programs are correct, and they do what you want them to do, asking how efficient they are. But back in the 1990s—where I go back to more or less—the computer science community realized you could essentially design programming languages where just to be a valid program already guaranteed some inefficiency. So you couldn’t write an efficient program to begin with. A colleague of mine in Syracuse University and I wondered, if we could take the same idea and make them work in languages that are similar to the languages people actually program in? Though that research led me to the original question of analyzing an existing program—are there ways of automating that analysis?",
      "But turns out, that got me interested in technical topics in computer science which also show up in a lot of other places. And this got me interested in program analysis—I realized I want to learn more about that\u00a0technique. Program analysis is really more the technique, but the questions are really more things like privacy and security, web browsing privacy, detecting what kinds of tracking websites are doing. Program analysis is kind of one way of answering those kinds of questions.\u00a0",
      "A: Could you tell me more about your academic journey?\u00a0",
      "ND: I did my undergraduate in math at UC Berkeley, and my graduate degree was in mathematics at Indiana. But my PhD advisor, Daniel Leivant, was in computer science. I had gone to Indiana to work in logic, [but] after about a year, I realized I really didn’t want to do that research. So we worked on finding another advisor, and connecting up with [Leivant]. The view of logic at Indiana, at least when I was there, was a very broad view: even if you’re getting a math PhD there’s no reason why you can’t work with a guy in computer science. And then I just got really lucky ultimately. I got a postdoctoral degree at UCLA in the math department, but it was for teaching basic programming classes. That was really lucky for me because I’d been thinking I want to move more towards computer science and that research, so that gave me the credentials to then get a job in a computer science programs.",
      "A: Would you say that your teaching approach has changed much over the years?",
      "ND: I suspect the answer is yes, but it might be more what I think is now more important to teach. I’ve certainly changed the mechanics of some courses a lot. I used to have very long bi-weekly or three-week long assignments in the introductory classes, just so you could get a lot of content in those. And I found that it just simply didn’t work at that particular level. So I’ve gone all the way back to essential weekly homework—which to me is much more boring, but the students end up learning the material better. We’ve certainly changed content, but that’s not so much me, that’s more [the whole Department]. We’ve thought about whether this is the right curriculum for computer science at Wesleyan—not so much about what they want to know, but what they should know to continue their studies.\u00a0",
      "A: What do you think about the\u00a0Code_Wes club\u00a0that students started to support coding interest on campus?",
      "ND: I think it’s awesome. This sort of thing comes and goes, and the more it comes, the better. I remember some 10–15 years ago, we had a cadre of students interested in having extracurricular coding and programming activities. We thought that was fantastic—you don’t learn everything in classes, and there’s no way you’re going to. So you should be reaching out. The fact that there is a cohort of welcoming students that gets everyone involved no matter what their level or what they can contribute is great. It would be nice if faculty had more time to organize things like this. But\u00a0one, we don’t, and\u00a0two, I’m not sure it would be so good. It’s probably better for students to figure out what they want to do.",
      "A: If you could give college freshmen interested in computer science any advice, what would it be?",
      "ND: The main thing I wish more of them would realize, is that what they’ve typically seen presented as computer science is not necessarily computer science. Computer science is a scientific discipline: we have research subjects, we have languages and techniques to ask and answer questions. And while programming certainly comes up for most of us, that’s not the actual science part. Occasionally it is and it’s important and it can be a lot of fun. But a lot of times, incoming freshmen, their perspective on computer science is that it’s mainly programming. So they can be a bit frustrated when they get to classes like [“Computer Science I” (COMP211) and “Computer Science II” (COMP212)], where, yes you have to do programming, but you have to do a lot\u00a0more.\u00a0",
      "A: That’s fascinating—especially because programming is just such a natural heuristic for thinking about computer science that it leaves very little room for anything else.\u00a0",
      "ND: That’s also important for incoming students to realize. It depends on how much they enjoy programming—if they absolutely hate sitting in front of a computer, computer science probably isn’t the best thing for them. But if you can treat sitting in front of the computer as a necessary chore to do the things that you like to do, there’s plenty to be done that’s not just programming. If you work in any of our research groups, certainly you’ll do some programming for many of us—but the interesting questions are deeper, they’re much, much deeper.",

      "Every year, the University admits a cohort of Foreign Language Teaching Assistants (FLTAs) from around the world to assist with the teaching of University language classes and act as cultural ambassadors. These non-degree-seeking students work under the Fries Center of Global Studies and offer a nuanced international perspective on Wesleyan’s culture.\u00a0",
      "The Argus sat down with one of this year’s 11 FLTAs, Aditya Raj, to talk about his experience and contribution to\u00a0the Wesleyan campus as a cultural ambassador\u00a0for India.\u00a0Despite his official title\u00a0as the University’s Hindi-Urdu FLTA, Raj is not an Urdu speaker and teaches only Hindi on campus, though these two languages are closely related. The following interview was conducted in Hindi and has been translated into English.",
      "The Argus:\u00a0Where do you call home?",
      "Aditya Raj: I am from North India, from the state of Bihar.\u00a0",
      "A: Could you tell us about your academic journey?",
      "AR: I received my Master’s from Delhi University (DU) in English Literature. I received my Ph.D. from Patna University, concentrating in science fiction and terraforming, doing critical studies of the works of Kim Stanley Robinson, who is an American science fiction author. He lives in California now, and I’m actually trying to meet him. About 20 days before coming to Wesleyan, I received my doctorate degree—which made transitioning here less stressful, knowing I had my degree in hand. I have written eight research articles published on\u00a0ResearchGate, and contributed two chapters in a published book,\u00a0Ethnicity, Identity, and Cultural Diversity: Multiple Perspectives.\u00a0I’m currently on a Fulbright scholarship to teach [at the University].",
      "A: That’s amazing. Can you tell us more about what specifically you wrote about in this book?\u00a0",
      "AR: Yes, in one of the chapters I analyzed how race and ethnicity are portrayed in the movie “Black Panther” (2018). If we look at most Marvel superhero movies, the protagonists are mostly white. I looked at how the Black superhero contributed to this franchise.\u00a0",
      "A: What inspired your interest in science fiction and literature?\u00a0",
      "AR: Well, actually, my interest was originally in the sciences. But I fell in love with literature. Up until 12th grade, I studied physics, chemistry, and mathematics. I wanted to study physics at Delhi University, and one of my alternatives\u00a0at the time was English. I was admitted to the English department at Delhi University, but not physics, despite applying for many different cut-off options. At the same time, I didn’t have a lot of guidance for the application process, although my father—who is a professor but not at DU—and I tried our best. I don’t like to belabor things, so I decided to just study what I was admitted for. Since my childhood, I dreamed of becoming an astronaut. My father and I would talk about me aspiring for NASA and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\u00a0",
      "When I started with English, I didn’t enjoy it at all in the beginning. I never read the assigned novels; I’d write assignments by watching their adapted movies instead. After a year, I realized that what I was doing was wrong—I thought, “If I am studying something, I should commit to it.” People say there’s a lot in literature, so I gave it a chance. In my second year, I read Ramachandra Guha on environmentalism, which I loved. After a few discussions with my professors, I realized my interest was in the literary genre of science fiction, which was very novel to me. It was then that I understood that English literature is amazingly vast—you can write about anything from medical literature to posthumanism. I loved that. Here I found a second chance at life. Although I didn’t become an astronaut, through literature I could fulfill my passion for science.\u00a0",
      "A: That’s such an interesting journey. Did you face any social challenges?",
      "AR: My parents are very educated folk, and it was always their hope that I go into higher education, but specifically into civil services. I did try for the Union Public Service Commission, but I didn’t qualify. But really, I wanted to go into teaching. I’d ask my father, “Why didn’t you go into civil services then? Why did you become a professor? I want to be a professor just like you.”\u00a0",
      "Many times I felt like I should give up—my friends were all getting jobs, getting married, settling down. And I did undergraduate education for three years, my masters for two years, and then my Ph.D. for five years. For a while I thought going into higher education was a mistake, but I eventually decided to trust the flow of things.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "A: Wow, that’s really remarkable, and now you’re here! From our experience as international students, India’s representation at Wesleyan is a bit polarized between Mumbai and Delhi. How do you plan to share Bihar’s unique culture at Wesleyan?\u00a0",
      "AR: I definitely plan to discuss Bihar’s culture in the Hindi language classes I TA for. We do have class movie nights, which would be a good opportunity for this, but Bihar doesn’t as of yet have movies specific to it. Other than that, Bihar is known for three things: Chhath Puja, a religious festival; Litti Chokha, a savory Indian dish; and Nalanda University. Nalanda University is a historic institution run by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. Students from China, Japan, and Korea study abroad there for linguistics. I, too, did a six-month French certificate course there.\u00a0",
      "I am not sure how successful this would be, but I would love to spearhead an exchange program between Wesleyan and Nalanda University. Nalanda is a very international university and culturally significant, so if an\u00a0M.O.U. (Memorandum of Understanding)\u00a0or something like that could be signed, especially for the Hindi-Urdu classes taught here, that would be great. I am definitely trying to get the discussion started both here and back in India with my colleagues. I’ve also brought some Madhubani paintings here as gifts for the faculty. Madhubani paintings are a very famous art form from Bihar, and only natural colors are used. I’ve shared this with my class as well. I hope to share Bihari culture here as much as possible.\u00a0",
      "A:\u00a0Can you talk about your relationship with the FLTA community?",
      "AR:\u00a0My bonding with them is great. In fact, we were all playing a French game called Werewolves and Villagers until midnight yesterday. We also ate dumplings together, and they made sure to make vegetarian dumplings according to my dietary preferences. We are all going to New Haven soon. It’s working out pretty well for us.",
      "A:\u00a0What do you think of the vegetarian food here?",
      "AR:\u00a0If I’m being honest, I am still struggling with finding vegetarian options here. There’s only tofu; pretty different from the paneer I’m used to eating. They do try to incorporate tofu into the dishes here with certain spices. I like the spices, but it is just not that great for me. All the other vegetables that are generally available are very new to me, as I have not eaten them before, so I am still adjusting to it.",
      "A:\u00a0Do you miss home?",
      "AR:\u00a0Yes, of course, I’ve only been here a month. Especially during this time of Dussehra (an Indian festival), there are a lot of festivities and carnivals back home, along with jalebis (an Indian dessert), that I really miss. It’s impossible to find a jalebi here easily.\u00a0",
      "A:\u00a0What’s that one thing that you have had trouble with while transitioning here?",
      "AR: I find the public transportation here pretty odd. It’s okay if you have a car, but if not, then there are some problems. You’d have to search properly for buses and their schedules. Back home, as soon as you step out, you’d be able to find a rickshaw or some other transport and would not really walk anywhere. Here, when I had to go to the Social Security Office, I had to walk there. There are times I walk to and from the grocery store, and I find this really weird. I don’t really have a choice other than that. Also, I’ve had some issues with returning my packages, because if they are from FedEx, they’ll have it picked up, but otherwise I have to go to their office to return them. It is so complicated at times that I don’t even return my packages. ",
      "A:\u00a0What are the similarities and differences between your home and Wesleyan?",
      "AR:\u00a0The system of learning here is very different compared to India. Back home, professors just deliver lectures, and most of them leave as soon as the session is over unless they have time left where students can actually ask questions. Whereas, here, when professors introduce a topic, they try to hold interactive discussions with the students. They are not similar at all in this context.",
      "When I think of similarities, I feel people are really helpful everywhere. In India, when people see someone in trouble, they try to help regardless of the other person asking for it. But here, according to me, unless you tell people you need help, help won’t be directly offered. I largely feel that it is about the privacy concern here. But again, this is based on what I’ve heard and not actually experienced.\u00a0",
      "A:\u00a0Is there anything else about the FLTAs that you would like Wesleyan’s community to know?",
      "AR:\u00a0I’d like everyone to know about the events being hosted during the International Education Week from Nov. 18 to Nov. 22 and the Language Fair on Friday, Oct. 11. The FLTAs participate in these events, and so I want the outreach for these to be better so that more people can attend. These events are pretty important for the FLTAs, as they try their best to represent their culture, but there’s relatively little participation.\u00a0",

      "A student group identifying themselves as Beyond Empire staged a 10-person sit-in in North College’s Investment Office on Friday, Sept. 20, calling for the Board of Trustees to vote yes on the Committee of Investor Responsibility’s (CIR) proposal regarding investments in companies supporting the internationally-sanctioned occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The Board of Trustees\u00a0vote on the CIR proposal\u00a0was scheduled to be held that weekend, on Saturday, Sept. 21.",
      "After refusing to leave the premises, five of the\u00a010 student protestors were detained on the\u00a0fourth floor of North College for one-and-a-half hours by the Middletown Police Department (MPD). Following the apprehension, students were escorted outside by the MPD and released, pending internal disciplinary charges.",
      "“The University called for police assistance only because the students refused to comply with reasonable time and place restrictions on their protest,” an all-campus email sent by University Communications shortly after the sit-in read. “For Wesleyan, it has always been a last resort to ask the police to assist in maintaining the University’s ability to conduct normal operations.”",
      "Beyond Empire initiated the sit-in in support of the divestment proposal\u00a0outlined by the CIR, a non-fiduciary committee of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA)\u00a0revived in Spring 2024\u00a0in response to campus-wide interest in the University’s investments. The CIR received specific requests from Wesleyan Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and the Faculty Ad-Hoc Network for Justice Palestine (FJP) in May to investigate the\u00a0University’s financial backing of companies supporting the internationally-sanctioned occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.\u00a0",
      "“The Wesleyan Committee for Investor Responsibility (CIR) is a student, faculty, staff, and alumni panel that advises the University’s Board of Trustees on ethical matters related to the endowment,” the WSA states on its\u00a0website. “It…seeks to represent and empower the Wesleyan community in advocating for greater transparency and shareholder engagement with respect to endowment assets.”",
      "Over\u00a0the summer, the CIR established a divestment subcommittee with the explicit task of developing a document outlining the ethical and financial implications of University investments in Israel and in companies associated with\u00a0Israel’s\u00a0internationally-sanctioned occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. On Friday,\u00a0Aug. 30, the CIR issued the proposal and presented it to both the board of trustees and the Wesleyan Investment Committee. IT is titled “Proposal Concerning the Divestment of Wesleyan University’s Endowment from Companies Which Supply Services, Equipment, or Weapons Involved in Israel’s Illegal Occupation of Palestinian and Syrian Territory.”",
      "In the early hours of Friday, Sept. 20, before the board of trustees convened to vote on the proposal, Beyond Empire uploaded an\u00a0Instagram post\u00a0encouraging followers to join the planned sit-in in dedication to Tala Abu Ajwa later that day. Ajwa was a 10-year-old Palestinian girl\u00a0murdered\u00a0in an Israeli airstrike on Wednesday, Sept. 4 in Gaza City, found wearing her pink roller skates.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "At noon on the day of the scheduled sit-in, Beyond Empire sent a letter to the Board of Trustees declaring that they were the autonomous group of ten students that had initiated the demonstration. They reiterated their demands: The board must vote yes on the CIR’s divestment proposal, a position which they affirmed had garnered support from students through petitions, committee participation, and personal pleas.\u00a0",
      "“We urge you to vote in favor of the CIR’s divestment proposal, which would significantly reduce our complicity in these atrocities, align with Wesleyan’s so-called ethical responsibility strategy, and protect human and non-human life,” Beyond Empire’s open letter read. “Vote to divest.”",
      "Ten\u00a0students subsequently entered North College and dropped down a blue banner with red lettering outside the fourth floor window, with the words “Tala Abu Ajwa Hall.” Students then reached the area outside the Office of Investments, wearing facial coverings including keffiyehs and sunglasses, and repeating pro-Palestinian chants.",
      "“The protestors were peacefully chanting outside the Investments Office for nearly half an hour before the police arrived,” an anonymous source working on the same floor as the Office of Investments at the time of the sit-in said.\u00a0",
      "Public Safety (PSafe) arrived shortly after. According to an all-campus email sent by University Communications four hours after the protest began, PSafe and Wesleyan’s Student Affairs team asked the students to leave, and told them that they were violating the student code of conduct by disrupting University operations.\u00a0Five of the students left voluntarily, but the remaining five refused to leave, after which the MPD was called on campus for intervention.\u00a0",
      "“Middletown Police arrived and restated the warnings, offering to let the students leave rather than be arrested,” the email read. “For Wesleyan, it has always been a last resort to ask the police to assist in maintaining the University’s ability to conduct normal operations.”",
      "A shared\u00a0Instagram post between SJP, Beyond Empire, and external groups CT for Palestine and CT Dissenters, however, contends that moments after the banner for Tala Abu Ajwa was dropped from the fourth floor of North College, President Michael Roth ’78 and University administration called the MPD. As various SJP members have noted, this is in direct contradiction to Roth’s article in the New Republic, entitled “Why I’m Not Calling the Police on my Students’ Encampment.”\u00a0",
      "“Roth continues to paint himself and Wesleyan as the defender of free speech and the right to protest—but students know the truth,” the post read. “He boasted about his refusal to call the police on the Wesleyan Palestine Solidarity Encampment last spring. What he was really celebrating was his reluctance to brutalize students, which should be the bare minimum.”",
      "Once the MPD arrived, students were asked to hand over their WesIDs and identify themselves and were subsequently handcuffed and fielded to conference room 405 for questioning. According to the SJP post, the five students were denied access to the bathroom, frisked, and were immediately threatened with suspension. They were then given the option to be released without charge on the condition that they leave the building.\u00a0",
      "A video\u00a0circulating\u00a0on SJP and Beyond Empire’s accounts on Instagram show a clip of the events inside the conference room—two students are seen with their hands held behind their backs by officers, and one student can be heard shouting that they were being handcuffed.\u00a0One\u00a0student in the video is grabbed by their shorts by an officer and touched repeatedly in the chest area, which the SJP statement characterized as groping, not standard police frisking.\u00a0",
      "Two protestors, Rowan Roudebush ’27 and Reana Akthar ’27, were among the five students\u00a0who stayed in North College when instructed to exit the building. They also recall being handcuffed, questioned, and having their belongings taken, including the Tala Abu Ajwa Hall banner and Roudebush’s drum.\u00a0",
      "“The police came upstairs and asked us to leave, we said we wouldn’t until [we saw] divestment from bombs being dropped on Palestinian families,” Roudebush said. “They put us in handcuffs and said they were going to arrest us…later they offered for us to not be arrested, and we decided it would be more useful for us to be available to mobilize for our objective.”",
      "The detained students also claimed that the officers threatened to file a $50,000 bond should the protestors remain on the premises.\u00a0",
      "Outside of North College, students and community members in support of the sit-in gathered by the North College steps to hear from other pro-Palestinian protestors, voicing support for their peers inside the building. Impromptu speeches about the CIR proposal and impending vote, a historical overview of the\u00a0Wesleyan South African divestment movement, and the implications of institutional investment were held to a crowd of over fifty.\u00a0",
      "“When students engage in peaceful protest here, they are arrested,” a student member of the CIR and speaker at the event\u00a0said. “And Michael Roth can write an article and dance around on how peaceful and…[how we have] neutral spaces to talk about whatever the fuck is happening in the world. And then when students try to hold them to that, they are arrested.”",
      "They also noted that the MPD has not been called by the University administration to intervene during any on-campus student protests for Palestine in the past year, distinguishing Wesleyan from similar institutions such as the\u00a0University of Chicago,\u00a0Columbia University, and\u00a0Pomona College.\u00a0",
      "“There’s no way they could have had any legal grounding for it,” Roudebush said. “There have been sit-ins at the University in the past and nothing has happened. Their response to us, the threats—they were all part of that facilitation for genocide.”",
      "Once the five students were released, they joined their supporters in front of North College, and watched as numerous police cars cleared the area. The doors to North College, South College, and nearby administrative buildings were subsequently locked by PSafe officers.\u00a0Though supporters included SJP members, Beyond Empire stated that they are not affiliated with SJP, even though both groups advocated for it. Non-Beyond Empire members also participated in\u00a0the sit-in.",
      "“This was all Beyond Empire [and other Wesleyan students],” Akthar\u00a0said. “…[Part] of Beyond Empire helped facilitate what was happening outside of the building, making sure that a crowd would be there in terms of people’s support. But SJP supports all autonomous actions taken in the name of freeing Palestine and they amplified our actions that day.”\u00a0",
      "Those affiliated with Beyond Empire expressed pride\u00a0in their actions that day, and vowed to continue protesting until University divestment is fully achieved.",
      "“I don’t think what students did today was inappropriate,” Akthar\u00a0said.\u00a0“I think this is well within what folks need to do to change the conversation and to hold people accountable, because we do not want our tuition dollars to be funding what’s happening in Gaza and the West Bank.”",
      "The now-released students will be appearing before the Community Standards Board on Thursday, Sept. 26, awaiting disciplinary action in response to the sit-in.\u00a0",

      "In his 40 years at the University, Professor of Biology Frederick Cohan has contributed to an august history of natural sciences, taught classes in evolutionary biology, ecology, and bioinformatics, and conducted dynamic research on bacteria. Now a Huffington Foundation Professor in the College of Environment (COE), Cohan sat down with The Argus to talk about his recent research in Death Valley, the interdisciplinary sciences, and how he has seen the University change over the years.",
      "The Argus: What first sparked your interest in evolutionary biology?",
      "Frederick Cohan:\u00a0I can’t even tell you really. I just found it the most interesting subject in college. I went to college at Stanford, and I did an honors project as an undergraduate some 50+ years ago about the hybridisation of oak species. I just thought the idea that species could learn new adaptations from other species through hybridization was fascinating. When I moved to bacteria, that possibility of inter-species gene exchange became so much more rampant and intriguing.",
      "A:\u00a0Sometime in your career you specialized in evolutionary bacteriology, what did that change look like for you?",
      "FC:\u00a0Why would anyone work with flies? I used to study Drosophila (a genus of flies) before bacteria. Bacteria are so interesting. Flies are very difficult in terms of the husbandry—you can’t just stick them in the freezer and come back when you’re interested. With bacteria you can do that, and I think that makes them so much nicer to work with. Finish a project, stick them in the freezer, and say, “Yeah, I’m going on vacation.”",
      "I got a post-doctorate job at the University of Arizona, which was my opportunity to study bacteria. I learned bacteria from John Spizizen—I’ll call him the grandfather of Bacillus Genetics. With the help of Conrad Istock at the University of Arizona, I became interested in the evolutionary ecology of Bacillus. I learned that I could collect it myself in the desert, and so we collected thousands of strains and have been studying them ever since. One of my ambitions was to discover how one bacterial species can split into two lineages—two lineages that can co-exist indefinitely because they’re ecologically different enough to do so.",
      "A:\u00a0Tell me about your research this summer.",
      "FC:\u00a0We went to Death Valley this August, for six days overall. The reason to go to Las Vegas—as everyone should know—is that it’s the gateway to Death Valley. The last time I did a major Bacillus collection there with my students was seven years ago, and then we collected Bacillus from different environments and elevations: below sea level, at sea level, up to 10,000 feet.",
      "This year, we were also looking at free soil and rhizosphere soil. An ecotype is basically a lineage that is ecologically homogenous and can co-exist forever with other ecotypes which it is ecologically different from. We’ve now shown that there’s at least several to many ecotypes in what people call a species—we used to think there might be a gazillion. In the work we’ve done so far, we found that there are a small number of ecotypes in each of the three focal species we’ve worked on, and they’re all interestingly different.",
      "So we took a new approach to sampling the diversity based on single genes. We wanted to compare the “modal genes” (given the modal number of ecotypes, five), with the high ecotype numbered genes with a PCR process. Our research methodology has evolved, because we’re doing a much more detailed environmental characterisation with chemical analysis of soil beyond just elevation and soil type consideration.",
      "It’s only been in the last year or so that we’ve actually figured out how to identify ecotypes, and how to determine that there’s really only a countable number of ecotypes for a species. To some extent you can take pride in knowing there’s lots of species, and sometimes you can say it’s an annoyance to know there’s so many. If there’s a billion of those [ecotypes] then you lose interest because it becomes fruitless to identify, name, and study interesting ones.",
      "This is work that really is based on the work of a dozen undergraduate students, B.A/M.A students. What we’ve done is sampled the sequence diversity of a gene, and found out how many sequence clusters there are, looking at the similarities and differences. We invented an algorithm that goes from the sequence clustering and identifies clusters that are ecotypes—and we’ve never got more than 10 ecotypes. And now we’re working on making a coffee table book on Bacillus! Some colleagues of mine are making coffee table books on fish, and Bacillus are so much more interesting than fish of course. The book’s going to be like a stamp collection of Bacillus.",
      "A:\u00a0Could you say more about how you imagine the book in parallel with stamp collection?",
      "FC:\u00a0I was a stamp collector as a kid. We are interested in making a complete registry of all bacterial species. Some people have estimated that there’s a trillion species. We have a long way to go to get to all of these obviously; we’ve only named about 20,000 so far. The way people have thought about reaching the entirety of bacterial diversity is by automating it. Based on the genome instead of necessarily culture, I imagine that we are going to have this big stamp collecting book of species. If you’ve ever seen a stamp collecting book, you’ll note that there are pages that are printed, meant to be filled in when you get the stamp. I think of this as being the book of life, where you can have something in principle based on genome sequence before even having them in culture.",
      "A:\u00a0What is your favorite class you have taught at Wesleyan?",
      "FC:\u00a0That would be “Global Change and Infectious Disease” (BIOL173). Before teaching that class I wasn’t really familiar with the topic, but I read this book “Six Modern Plagues and How We Are Causing Them” by Mark Jerome Walters. What I found really interesting about this book, not having studied infectious diseases before this, was that he made a case to a popular audience that there’s all these ways we alter the environment that brings us novel infectious diseases. The way I teach the course—going chronologically through history—the ways we have disturbed the environment are related to procuring food, disturbing human population density, usage of land, the global transportation of organisms, harnessing energy, and the last is healthcare.",
      "The punchline of all this in the course is that there’s always going to be an unending parade of plagues, and we cover how to fix them. What happened before this class got popular with students is that students would take the course and decide that they wanted to go into public health. So many students have gone into that not expecting that [it] would be their career. I figure we need a lot more people in public health—more than we do in studies of origins of bacterial species. So I’m happy to teach that class to as many people who want to take it.",
      "A:\u00a0You’ve been here nearly 39 years. How have you seen the University change?",
      "FC:\u00a0I finished my 38th year working here this May. This place is amazing. Something I started to appreciate after my first decade here is the great interest in interdisciplinarity here. And it started across the street. You folks, your professors from a decade ago were very interested in doing research across divisions, teaching classes across divisions, and that, as a spectator, was pretty interesting. In retrospect, I think I came here as a scientist pretty blindered.",
      "In the last 20 years, the sciences here have become much more interdisciplinary. So here’s an example: one of my closest colleagues, [Professor of Computer Science] Daniel Krizanc, is a computer scientist. We’ve co-authored papers a dozen times, taught a class together five times, he comes to all my lab meetings. And he wasn’t a biologist when we started, but he is now. And I wouldn’t say that I’ve become a computer scientist, but I will say that I wrote the cotype simulation code with his help. And I just think that interdisciplinary learning spirit, even within faculty, is so great.",
      "The College of the Environment (COE) is also a great example of how the sciences have evolved here. I was one of the founding professors for the COE and will be chair of the Environmental Studies major program next year. The COE is an amazing interdisciplinary program that encourages students to apply what they are learning in their principal major toward solving environmental challenges. At this point, nearly every major or program has been represented among our COE graduates.",
      "A:\u00a0What does your off time look like?",
      "FC:\u00a0On vacation, I usually work in the mornings and then my wife and I hike all afternoon, go out for dinners. This recent vacation I wrote the algorithmic code for the ecotype simulation.",
      "A:\u00a0How do you think the University has accommodated and facilitated the growth of the Natural Sciences Department over the years?",
      "FC:\u00a0We have been supported by the University to have the teaching load that allows us to seriously engage with our students and our work. The deal is we teach the number of courses that allows us to connect with students in our classroom—which is amazing. But we also have time to be working in the lab every week, working with our students elbow-to-elbow every week.\u00a0[There are]\u00a0so many students who are interested in working with us. The past few years I’ve had 16 to 18 students in my lab every year—which is a lot—but we have found a way to make that work. I’ll say the B.A./M.A. program has been a change that has allowed the University to support students who have been here for a few years as undergraduates, and this gives them an additional year to advance their scientific careers. I’ve had a B.A./M.A. student every other year in the past years, and it’s worked out beautifully. The University supports us in contributing to knowledge, and also in our training of students.",
      "A:\u00a0Are there any non-biology/ecology books you’ve been reading lately?",
      "FC:\u00a0A book that I found out about recently is a new one by Timothy Snyder, one of my favorite authors. His last book was on tyranny, and we get tired of that. But his new book is “On Freedom.” His idea is that we typically think of freedom as freedom from oppression, government, control et cetera, but he wants us to think of it as freedom to love who you want, to talk about what you want, and I think that’s just so interesting. I also love Eugenia Cheng, who is a mathematician who writes math books for laymen, which are all great. I’ve read three of her books so far. I just read “Is Math Real?” by her. She opens a lot of avenues to talk about math in her books, which is pretty amazing.",

    content: [
      "A year ago, I wrote\u00a0an article\u00a0about my experience at\u00a0International Student Orientation (ISO) as a participant. Reading it now, my takes seem so simple, and perhaps that is due\u00a0to the rigorous planning behind ISO that makes it appear\u00a0seamless. This year, being an Orientation Leader (OL) for ISO was truly a through-the-looking-glass experience into all of its\u00a0detailed logistics.\u00a0",
      "One of the remarkable parts of this experience was working with people who were OLs during my own orientation. I felt\u00a0like I did not know\u00a0nearly enough to work alongside them. And yet, the international Wesleyan community never ceases to surprise me: In between compiling 120+ orientation packets in under an hour, hauling bedding to students’ dorms, and bringing water to the Cardinal on duty, I not only learned how to handle OL duties for the\u00a0first time, but also made many unexpected friends.",
      "One of my mentors, returning OL Cecilia\u00a0Foldessy-Stiegemeier ’26, helped affirm my first-timer experience by sharing her own.",
      "“I feel a lot more confident in my role as an orientation leader the second time around,”\u00a0Foldessy-Stiegemeier said.“I think it’s such a special role where I’m able to see my development in terms of the skills I’ve picked up both as a leader and an individual.”",
      "As for my ISO\u00a0group, I thought I was ready to be a great OL. Some top tips were to wear comfortable shoes for ISO; take a language course; don’t leave friends behind at parties; don’t be intimidated by the Americans; and most importantly, wait for the free orientation Wesleyan merch instead of buying expensive stuff.",
      "But the position did come with its challenges: engaging students experiencing jet lag, homesickness, vaccination side-effects (or a combination of these), while being very understandable, taking careful, resolute actions. It was important to make space for participants’ own well-being while also ensuring that they did not miss out on important events and information.\u00a0",
      "Another challenge, one of the more important points all the OLs discussed in the feedback session, was\u00a0the issue of the flags during the group photo.",
      "The group photo was a part of ISO I enjoyed rather thoughtlessly last year. Country flags are\u00a0handed out to ISO participants on a first-come basis, with no rigid formula as to who would get which flag. As a participant, I thought it was endearing for students to hold flags of countries they didn’t necessarily have relations with.",
      "This year, hearing participants’ and other OLs’ perspectives taught me how complex this activity\u00a0can actually be. I had not imagined that some students would, in this scenario, have to hold flags of countries which their country/identity had tense relations with. This is especially more true for students hailing from post-colonial nations.\u00a0",
      "“While giving out the flags to the students–despite knowing the passport country of most students–I wasn’t comfortable deciding which flag to hand out to which student,” said ISO Intern Alex Arrieta-Srivastava ’27. “There’s also problems with how the photo and its promotion can be misleading regarding diversity…even if someone has a connection with the flag they’re holding, another student may feel uncomfortable seeing that flag.”",
      "The student staff also discussed many alternatives with Arrieta-Srivastava\u00a0for the group photo, such as having a choice form for the students to fill out addressing who would want to hold the flags, or having a banner that can be held up instead.\u00a0",
      "What should also be questioned is the social media promotion of photos like the ISO group photo. Since one flag of each country in the world is printed out, the OLs did have a conversation about how this\u00a0could paint a\u00a0manufactured picture of diversity\u00a0at Wesleyan. And yet at the same time, without promotional strategies like these, the University would perhaps be limited in attracting international students from around the world, who are without a doubt core assets to the student body.\u00a0",
      "“[This is] true but I also think it’s very difficult,” Foldessy-Stiegemeier said.“Last year, the University posted on Instagram about New Student Orientation but not International Student Orientation, and we started commenting on that post saying things like ‘Hey, we exist too.’ So, this year they have learned from that, and immediately posted about ISO–but then there’s also the issue of sensitivity about the flags.”\u00a0",
      "So there seems to be a dilemma–representation and promotion for international students is\u00a0important, but it may do just as much harm as good if not done well by the University’s social media teams.\u00a0The Office of International Affairs (OISA)\u00a0does remain\u00a0open to feedback and updates that can make this experience more inclusive and comfortable, and perhaps we will see change in the future.",
      "However, there were also memorable, tried and tested parts of ISO I was able to experience as an OL. One of the worries I had was connecting adequately with my group–two days to connect with 10 kids seemed like an emotional speedrun. But I was pleasantly surprised: With much of my group, it was so natural to connect with students, especially individually.",
      "In my past article I wrote that my favorite part of ISO was a group bonding activity where everyone shared a song from their own country. This time around, my favorite part was arrival day: hectic at the time, but, in hindsight, so sweet. While picking up participants from the Bradley International Airport (BDL) who were traveling alone was difficult, especially considering my own navigational inexperience, seeing each student help the others\u00a0haul up their luggage to their dorms (despite just having traveled for 15+ hours) was amazing.\u00a0",
      "In this reflection of ISO the second time around, I do believe pre-orientation programs such as ISO highlight the benefits of Wesleyan’s small community, but also taking a closer look at ISO provides more insight into the interactions between members of the global community here at the University.\u00a0I stay ever convinced of the unflagging efforts of the international community here–be it students, volunteers, or professional staff–to support itself and create environments of prosperity.\u00a0",
